%Online Appendix Table 1 presents regression results of the above Equation (Column 1) in comparison with the expected tone model results in \citeA{huangToneManagement2014} (Column 2). Dependent variable $tone_{i,t}$ is defined as net positive words, and is calculated as total number of positive words minus the sum of total number of negative words and total number of negations, deflated by total words. Independent variables are defined in \hyperref[appc]{Appendix C}. All financial variables except returns are winsorized at 1\% and 99\% level. ***, ** and * indicate significance at the 1\%, 5\% and 10\% levels in a two-tailed test. The coefficient of MTB in Column 1 is consistent with that in Column 2 in terms of sign, because \citeA{huangToneManagement2014} use book-to-market ratio instead of market-to-book ratio in the expected tone model.
