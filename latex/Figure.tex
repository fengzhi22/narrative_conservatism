	\noindent Figure 1 illustrates the 8-K sample matching process. We match every 8-K day to its nearest news day. The news day can be earlier than (Match-1), the same as (Match-2) or later than (Match-3) the 8-K day. TLAG is defined as the number of days elapsed between the 8-K filing date and its nearest news day.
