We provide further support for this view by documenting that the reversal in relative took place during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and resulted from societies with good institutions taking advantage of the opportunity industrialize.},

Chinese sellers earn 1.7\% higher premiums when selling homes to Chinese buyers in high Chinese concentrations housing blocks, but Malay sellers accept 1.6\% discounts from Malay buyers in the same blocks. We find that the high volume of within-ethnicity transactions with the price discounts is supported by the ethnic social networks, that is, through ethnicity-specialized real estate agents.

In addition, our results suggest that the increase in conservatism is more pronounced in near insolvent Delaware firms with stronger boards, confirming that the court ruling takes effect through the channel of the board of directors. Our results are robust to using alternative measures of conservatism and near insolvency status, and controlling for potential confounding factors and other stakeholders' demand for conservatism. Overall, our study provides empirical evidence to support the causal relation between debtholders' demand and accounting conservatism previously suggested in the literature, and offers some insights into the role of the board of directors in financial reporting.},

The recognition of the Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine (IDD) by courts in the U.S. states in which the firms are headquartered places greater restrictions on their managers from joining or forming a rival company. We find that, on average, the IDD adoption increases the asymmetric withholding of bad news. We further show that the IDD adoption increases the asymmetric withholding of bad news relative to good news for firms whose managers are mainly concerned about losing their current job. However, an opposite effect is observed for firms whose managers are mainly interested in seeking promotion elsewhere. Furthermore, these effects are less pronounced for firms subject to greater monitoring of their disclosure policy. These results suggest that managers' career concerns affect corporate disclosure policy, and the effect varies with the type of career concerns.},

We find this negative association to be more prominent after the 2008-09 crisis period; we interpret this evidence as indicating that macroeconomic conditions can impact on managerial choices over CSR and catering for capital providers, with the latter being a priority during an economic slowdown. We also find the negative association between conservatism and CSR to be more pronounced under higher levels of outside pressure from debt and equity holders, and for more financially constrained firms. Thus, our findings indicate that, under monitoring pressure from financial stakeholders, firms prioritize commitment to conservative reporting over the needs of nonfinancial stakeholders and other interest groups.},

We show that the level of disclosure transparency is negatively associated with both disagreement among analysts, a proxy for information uncertainty, and disagreement between analysts and managers, a proxy for information asymmetry. Further, we find that discount-rate-related disclosure transparency is associated with both types of analyst disagreement, while cash-flow-related disclosure transparency is associated with disagreement between analysts and managers only. Our paper speaks to the usefulness of goodwill impairment test disclosures to analysts, while also highlighting that opportunistic and boilerplate disclosure by some firms hampers the ability to resolve information asymmetry and information uncertainty.},

Seven academic proxies are significantly associated with only one audit process quality measure, and five have insignificant associations with both practitioner assessments. Overall, the significant associations indicate that practitioners and academics share common ground in identifying low-quality audits.

Based on prior research, we modify Basu's measure in four simple ways to remove these biases. Our key modification is the inclusion of interactive controls for return variance, a volatility proxy that directly captures biases associated with Patatoukas and Thomas' (2011) return variance effect and also with various sources of economic optionality and adjustment costs. The inclusion of these interactive controls captures volatility-related effects on both the level of earnings and the sensitivity of earnings to returns, and it allows the magnitudes of these effects to vary with the sign of returns. Using placebo tests, synthetic returns, and other validation analyses, we show that our modified asymmetric timeliness measure is largely free of known biases and is associated with contracting and other economic variables as predicted by theory. We conclude that, after necessary surgical intervention, the news about the death of Basu's measure has been greatly exaggerated.},

Across multiple proxies for career concerns, we find that the extent to which managers delay bad news is positively associated with their level of career concerns. Then, we hand-collect data on a compensation contract that firms use to reduce CEOs' career concerns (i.e., ex ante severance pay agreements). We find that if managers receive a sufficiently large payment in the event of dismissal, they no longer delay the disclosure of bad news. Overall, our findings support prior theoretical evidence that managers delay bad news disclosure due to career concerns and suggest a mechanism through which firms can mitigate the delay.},

Furthermore, the pricing attenuation of tone is increasing in the imprecision of the quantitative forecast, suggesting that lower forecast quality compromises the quantitative signal's credibility enhancement. Managerial incentives to inflate tone lead to the verification effect being greater for optimistic language, while management's use of hyperbole results in attenuation of the tone's pricing.},

At the macro level, innovations in policy uncertainty foreshadow declines in investment, output, and employment in the United States and, in a panel vector autoregressive setting, for 12 major economies.

We analyze the measure's validity, in the context of a model with accounting income incorporating different types of information with different lags, and with noise. We demonstrate that the asymmetric timeliness coefficient varies with firm characteristics affecting their information environments, such as the length of the firm's operating and investment cycles, and its degree of diversification. We particularly examine one characteristic, the extent to which ``unbooked'' information (such as revised expectations about rents and growth options) is independent of other information, and discuss the conditions under which a proxy for this characteristic is the market-to-book ratio. We also conclude that much criticism of the Basu regression misconstrues researchers' objectives.},

Correlation between the expected components of earnings and returns biases estimates of how earnings incorporate the information contained in returns. Further, the correlation varies with returns, biasing asymmetric timeliness estimates.

We conclude that the average quarterly announcement is associated with approximately 1\% to 2\% of total annual information, thus providing a modest but not overwhelming amount of incremental information to the market. The results are consistent with the view that the primary economic role of reported earnings is not to provide timely new information to the share market. By inference, that role lies elsewhere, for example, in settling debt and compensation contracts and in disciplining prior information,including more timely managerial disclosures of information originating in the firm's accounting system. The relative informativeness of earnings announcements is a concave function of size. Increased information during earnings-announcement windows in recent years is due only in part to increased concurrent releases of management forecasts.},

We find that the contemporaneous stock market seems to recognize some of the intangible asset value implicit in SG\&A. Positive subsequent returns can be earned in firms with a high SG\&A intangible asset value. These excess returns are more likely due to investor mispricing than to risk compensation. Furthermore, we find that both analysts' long-term growth forecast revisions and one-year-ahead forecast errors are positively associated with the future value created by current SG\&A, indicating that analysts partially incorporate the intangible SG\&A asset value into their forecasts. Overall, the evidence suggests that the capital market only partially recognizes the intangible asset value created by SG\&A expenditure.},

Using management earnings guidance and 8-K filings as measures of voluntary disclosure, we find a negative relation between bad-news disclosure and residual short interest, suggesting that managers withhold bad news in general. This tendency is tempered when firms are exposed to higher litigation risk, and it is strengthened when managers have greater incentives to support the stock price. Based on a novel approach to identifying the presence of bad news, our study adds to the debate on whether managers tend to withhold or release bad news.},

It also reveals that recognition of an accounting amount alters each of these, thereby affecting price informativeness. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that recognition of a highly unreliable accounting amount, rather than simply disclosing it, can result in greater price informativeness. Likewise, recognition of a highly reliable amount can result in lower price informativeness. Our findings suggest that, because of the effects of aggregation, basing recognition decisions on reliability alone is too simplistic. Reliability relative to relevance is key, not reliability per se. We also find that recognition and disclosure affect the coefficients in a regression of price on accounting amounts.},

It finds substantial variations from Delaware's law. Unlike Delaware, most of the states with relatively strong other constituency and pill endorsement statutes do not impose enhanced fiduciary duties on managers in change-of-control situations. Instead, they apply only the ordinary business judgment rule to management's use of antitakeover tactics. This Article has implications for antitakeover law, the market for corporate law, and the desirability of federal intervention. In particular, it provides support for adopting Delaware's enhanced fiduciary duties--Unocal, Revlon, and Blasius--as federally imposed mini-mum standards. This would not only improve state antitakeover law outside Delaware, but may also result in improvements to Delaware law since Delaware is currently dragged down by other states.},

This result is consistent with our expectations that high CSR firms enjoy low information asymmetry and high stakeholder solidarity (stakeholder theory). Moreover, our findings suggest that CSR components that are directly related to firms' primary stakeholders (e.g. employee relations, product characteristics, environment, and diversity) are more relevant in reducing investment inefficiency compared with those related to secondary stakeholders (e.g. human rights and community involvement). Finally, additional results show that the effect of CSR on investment efficiency is more pronounced during the subprime crisis. Taken together, our results highlight the important role that CSR plays in shaping firms' investment behaviour and efficiency.},

We use plant-level data and exploit a unique feature of corporate law that allows us to deal with possible biases associated with the timing of the laws.

Finally, overall productivity and profitability decline in response to these laws.

Moreover, we show that management style is significantly related to manager fixed effects in performance and that managers with higher performance fixed effects receive higher compen sation and are more likely to be found in better governed firms. In a final step, we tie back these findings to observable managerial characteristics.

We show that firms that just beat analyst forecasts with low quality earnings exhibit a short-term stock price benefit relative to firms that miss forecasts with high quality earnings. This trend, however, reverses over a 3-year horizon. Additionally, firms reducing discretionary expenditures to beat forecasts have significantly greater equity issuances and insider selling in the following year, consistent with managers understanding the myopic nature of their actions. Our results confirm survey evidence suggesting managers engage in myopic behavior to beat benchmarks.},

In the U.S., in contrast, the regulator decided against such rotation. Whereas proponents argue that rotation would strengthen independence and decrease audit market concentration, opponents stress the importance of auditors' learning effects, which would be eliminated by a change in auditors. In extending the market matching model of Salop (1979), we provide an analysis that integrates these contradictory views. We assume that both auditors' industry expertise and their experience in auditing a client decrease audit costs. We investigate the bidding strategies applied to re-acquire clients that were lost due to rotation, auditors' profit contributions, the equilibrium number of auditors (i.e., audit market concentration), and the economic importance of specific clients. Our findings indicate that the regulators' goals of simultaneously decreasing client importance and audit market concentration are in direct conflict and, therefore, the rotation system might have unintended consequences. Our model, thus, suggests how different institutional parameters give rise to economic forces that can support diverging decisions regarding the implementation of MAR.},

  abstract = {An emerging literature in accounting and finance has shown that, incremental to quantitative accounting information, qualitative or narrative information in financial disclosure can also provide new information to the market. One limitation of these studies is that they largely focus on the overall tone of financial disclosure, leaving unanswered questions about the importance of its underlying components. This study seeks to further our understanding of narrative disclosure news by investigating whether its temporal components (i.e., forwardlooking vs. non-forward-looking) differentially relate to its information content. We find evidence of a significant wedge between the way the market incorporates forward- versus nonforward-looking news, with the market response to forward-looking news being roughly 75 percent smaller than the response to non-forward-looking news. In examining several possible explanations for the wedge, we find little evidence that the wedge can be explained by information processing costs related to the textual characteristics of disclosure. However, the information wedge is explained in part by both analysts' expectations of future fundamentals and realizations of those fundamentals. Further, when considering the context in which firms' make disclosures, we find that the information gap between forward and non-forward-looking news is larger for firms with poor performance, in financial distress, or in highly competitive industries. Additional tests reveal that managers' appear to strategically alter their relative use of forward and non-forward-looking news when so incentivized. Our findings contribute to the recent accounting and finance literature on disclosure that shows the importance of examining the characteristics of qualitative disclosure to better understand how managers communicate with the marketplace and how market participants process and interpret such communication. Our paper provides a natural extension of a nascent literature which has yet to ``open up the black box,'' as it were, of qualitative news by examining its temporal dimension.},

Several recent studies find various stock price-related incentives for strategic filing behavior for firms with publicly traded equity. In this study, we use 8-K filings from firms with public filings (mostly from public debt) but non-public equity ownership from 2004\textendash 2014 to explore the strategic timing behavior of firms without stock price motivations. Consistent with strategic disclosure, we find evidence that bad news 8-Ks are more likely to be filed when market attention is lower (just after markets close, on Fridays, and after markets close on Fridays) even absent stock price concerns. Cross-sectionally, we find more strategic timing for firms with external scrutiny from analysts and credit rating agencies, despite the sophistication of those market participants. Within firms, we also find more strategic timing around public debt offerings, a time of increased market scrutiny for private firms. Lastly, we use EDGAR download data to provide supporting evidence that strategic timing of bad news disclosures does reduce short-window stakeholder attention to the bad news. Overall, we provide evidence that privately owned firms behave strategically within the 8-K reporting rules despite the lack of stock price incentives.},

Our out-of-sample tests indicate that topic significantly improves the detection of financial misreporting by as much as 59\% when added to models based on commonly used financial and textual style variables. Furthermore, models that incorporate topic significantly outperform traditional models when detecting serious revenue recognition and core expense errors.

  abstract = {Conditional conservatism is an integral but often unmodeled part of the normal accrual process. The standard economic determinants of accruals contain information about unrealized losses. We argue that accountants recognize these unrealized losses as disaggregated write-downs for small asset pools. Modeling disaggregated impairments yields new economic insights about accruals and improved accrual models. We predict that accrual conservatism manifests as a sum of asymmetries for a vector of news indicators, rather than as an asymmetry for a scalar aggregate news proxy. We argue that more detailed segment-level and quarterly indicators have an incremental effect on annual firm-level accruals. We also predict a dynamic effect of successive loss indicators because accountants look for consistent patterns in these variables. Empirical results for U.S. firms support our predictions. The asymmetries in accruals are consistent with conservatism in validation tests. We also document improved statistical power and type I error in earnings management tests.},

We focus on all news stories about a firm, not just those that report on specific CSR initiatives, and find that more socially responsible firms receive more favorable news reportage overall, i.e., they have a more positive media image. These findings are robust after controlling for potential endogeneity. Further, consistent with firms actively managing their media image, we find a stronger relation between CSR and media favorability when incentives to improve a firm's media image are high, e.g., among firms in sin industries, during periods of low investor sentiment, and prior to seasoned equity offerings. Finally, we find that for firms that demonstrate superior social responsibility and receive more favorable news reporting, there is a significant interaction between social responsibility and media favorability that increases (decreases) a firm's equity valuation (cost of capital). Our results are consistent with the media slanting their reporting in favor of good performing CSR firms. Overall, we contribute to the literature by showing that firms can influence their media coverage through a relatively subtle channel, CSR performance.},

We show that the asymmetric properties of conservative accounting, the existence of non-accounting sources of information, and the properties of GAAP related to special items combine to generate a nonlinear relation between unexpected equity returns and earnings news (the shock to expected current and future earnings). Based on this model, we construct a conservatism ratio (CR) defined as the ratio of the current earnings shock to earnings news. CR measures the proportion of the total shock to expected current and future earnings recognized in current year earnings. Ranking firms according to CR, we show empirically that higher CR firms have more leverage, increased volatility of returns, more incidence of losses, more negative accruals, and increased volatility of earnings and accruals, consistent with the literature on conservative accounting.},

In this study, we examine the information content of this newly created section and offer two main results. First, we find that firms facing greater risk disclose more risk factors, and that the type of risk the firm faces determines whether it devotes a greater portion of its disclosures towards describing that risk type. That is, managers provide risk factor disclosures that meaningfully reflect the risks they face. Second, we find that the information conveyed by risk factor disclosures is reflected in systematic risk, idiosyncratic risk, information asymmetry, and firm value. Overall, our evidence supports the SEC's decision to mandate risk factor disclosures, as the disclosures appear to be firm-specific and useful to investors.},

We first show that 10-K CSR disclosure intensity is associated with lower levels of gross margin but higher SG\&A margin. We then observe that firms with more CSR keywords in their 10-Ks maintain more persistent above-industry-median gross and operating margins. Upon sorting our full set of 10-K CSR keywords into three subcategories (philanthropy, business practice, and product), we find that the intensities of disclosure in these CSR subcategories have associations with varying competitive advantages.},

To determine whether referees as a whole impose different standards for female authors, we compare citations for female- and male-authored papers, holding constant referee evaluations and other characteristics. We find that female-authored papers receive about 25\% more citations than observably similar male-authored papers. Editors largely follow the referees, resulting in a 1.7 percentage point lower probability of a revise and resubmit verdict for papers with female authors relative to a citation-maximizing benchmark. In their desk rejection decisions, editors treat female authors more favorably, though they still impose a higher bar than would be implied by citation maximization. We find no differences in the informativeness of female versus male referees or in the weight that editors place on the recommendations of female versus male referees. We also find no differences in editorial delays for female- versus male-authored papers.},

Using data from Australia, where the audit partner can be identified and for a period where partner rotation was not mandatory, we examine the association between audit quality and long audit partner tenure. The three measures of audit quality examined are the auditor's propensity to issue a going-concern audit opinion for distressed companies, the direction and amount of abnormal working capital accruals, and just beating (missing) earnings benchmarks. For long tenure observations we find a lower propensity to issue a going-concern opinion and some evidence of just beating (missing) earnings benchmarks, consistent with deterioration in audit quality associated with long audit partner tenure. There is no evidence of an association of long audit tenure with abnormal working capital accruals.},

We find that investment professionals primed with a managerial performance evaluation objective assess financial accounting information to be less relevant than those primed with a firm valuation objective.

Investment professionals' views of representational faithfulness are positively associated with their assessments of corporate governance quality and negatively associated with the assessed complexity of the accounting measurement system.

Consistent with this implication, we find that positive tone in forwardlooking qualitative statements is significantly less related to the likelihood of subsequent litigation than is positive tone in non-forward-looking qualitative statements. On average, we fail to find a significant association between qualitative forward-looking statements and subsequent litigation. We do find evidence, however, that positive tone in qualitative forward-looking statements relates positively to subsequent litigation in two U.S. circuits in which court rulings reduced safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements.

SFAS 142 eliminated the periodic amortization of goodwill, replacing it with an annual fair value test for impairment with write-offs if necessary, and required that a firm's goodwill be allocated to its reporting units. Subsequently, the frequency of goodwill impairments increased, suggesting that SFAS 142 resulted in an increase in conditional conservatism, as firms were now forced to recognize losses that would have been deferred as periodic expenses under the previous gradual amortization regime. Using both market- and accounting-based measures, we find a decrease in both acquisition profitability and risk in the post-SFAS 142 period, relative to acquisitions pre-SFAS 142. By contrast, Canadian firms, which were not affected by SFAS 142, did not experience such changes. Thus, our results suggest that conditional conservatism is associated with decreased risk taking but is not associated with increased acquisition profitability. More generally, our results call into question the benefits of conditional conservatism that have been documented in the literature.},

This paper investigates the determinants of the dispersion in interest rates on loans granted by banks to small and medium sized enterprises. We associate this dispersion with the loan officers' use of ``discretion'' in the loan rate setting process. We find that ``discretion'' is most important if: (i) loans are small and unsecured; (ii) firms are small and opaque; (iii) the firm operates in a large and highly concentrated banking market; and (iv) the firm is distantly located from the lender. Consistent with the proliferation of information-technologies in the banking industry, we find a decreasing role for ``discretion'' over time in the provision of small credits to opaque firms. While widely used in the pricing of loans, ``discretion'' plays only a minor role in the decisions to grant loans.},

Consistent with our predictions, the frequency of, and stock returns to, reputation-building actions are greater for restating firms in the period after their restatement than for the control groups. In addition, firm characteristics predict the types of stakeholders targeted by firms.

Managers are also more likely to delay a disclosure when there has been a disclosure made within the three days before the event date. Finally, managers are more likely to engage in disclosure smoothing when disclosures are longer, the information environment is more robust, firm information is complex, uncertainty is high, and disclosure news is more positive. Our second set of analyses examines whether there are market benefits to disclosure smoothing. Using two different measures of disclosure smoothing, we find that smoothing is associated with increased liquidity, reduced stock price volatility and increased analyst forecast accuracy.},

We rely on the organizational literature to develop our prediction that firms utilizing the innovative ``prospector'' strategy will be more likely than firms utilizing the cost-leadership ``defender'' strategy to receive both going concern and material weakness opinions. Our empirical evidence supports this prediction. Specifically, we find that, among a sample of financially troubled firms, prospectors are significantly more likely than defenders to receive a going concern opinion. We then analyze a sample of clients who subsequently filed for bankruptcy and find that auditors are less likely to issue going concern opinions to prospector clients. This indicates that auditors commit more Type II errors when auditing prospector clients. We also find that prospectors are significantly more likely than defenders to receive a material weakness opinion. Taken together, the evidence suggests that business strategy is a significant determinant of both going concern and material weakness auditor reporting.},

Using a large cross-section of firms, we find that firms with better CSR performance face significantly lower capital constraints. We provide evidence that both better stakeholder engagement and transparency around CSR performance are important in reducing capital constraints. The results are further confirmed using several alternative measures of capital constraints, a paired analysis based on a ratings shock to CSR performance, an instrumental variables approach, and a simultaneous equations approach.

We show that the typical implementation of this procedure generates biased coefficients and standard errors that can lead to incorrect inferences, with both Type I and Type II errors. We further show that the magnitude of the bias in coefficients and standard errors is a function of the correlations between model regressors. We illustrate the potential magnitude of the bias in accounting research in four commonly used settings. Our results indicate significant bias in many of these settings. We offer three solutions to avoid the bias.},

Such manipulation reduces accounting numbers' stewardship value and leads to inferior risk sharing. We then show that risk sharing, and hence contract efficiency, can be improved under a conservative accounting standard where, absent earnings management, accounting earnings represent true economic earnings with a downward bias, compared with under an unbiased standard where, absent earnings management, accounting earnings represent true economic earnings without bias.},

For the quantitative information, we use the K-means method to cluster each company's financial performance data into ``Good'' or ``Poor'' groups. Consistency is said to occur when the textual and numerical data form either a ``Positive-Good'' pair or a ``NegativePoor'' pair. The design model is presented in a stepwise fashion and therefore is transparent for evaluation and validation. Our evaluation process demonstrates the feasibility of the design model. The evaluation was conducted using listed semiconductor companies in countries with different levels of market development. The results show that U.S. firms are less likely to exaggerate in their narrative disclosures and are more likely to understate their performance in MD\&As compared to companies in other markets such as China and Taiwan.},

Similarly, companies deemed to no longer have substantial doubt of continuing as a going concern are still more likely to declare bankruptcy than companies with no going concern opinion in either year. Results in both settings suggest the presence of residual risk that cannot be communicated through a binary audit report, despite the fact that auditors recognize the risk, as evidenced by higher audit fees and longer audit report lags.

Norm activation, in turn, influences managers' investment decisions to the extent that social norms are congruent with personal norms. As predicted, we find that the level of CSR investment is higher under a nonfinancial measurement basis than under a financial measurement basis, but only when the manager is personally supportive of CSR. Supplemental analysis indicates that CSR-supportive managers continue to invest more under a combined financial/nonfinancial measurement basis than under a financial measurement basis only.

The ambiguity associated with REM, and the fact that REM does not violate GAAP, may explain why its use is on the rise. While some assert that auditors are not, and should not be, concerned with REM, recent research suggests that REM may influence some auditor judgments. Using Correspondent Inference Theory (CIT) as our theoretical framework, we extend REM research by investigating the ways in which auditors respond to REM and how auditors deal with the intrinsic ambiguity associated with REM. We administer a 3\texttimes 2 between-subjects experiment to 113 highly-experienced auditors, manipulating the level of ambiguity surrounding the observed REM (Explicit REM, Potential REM, or No REM) and the earnings context in which the client engages in REM (the client beat or missed the consensus earnings forecast). We find that auditors respond to REM by lowering assessments of management tone (i.e., management's commitment to a culture of high ethical standards), being more likely to discuss the issue with the audit committee, and being less likely to retain the client. Auditors respond to Explicit REM regardless of the earnings context, but respond to Potential (i.e., ambiguous) REM only when the client beats the forecast. Finally, we find that management tone mediates the relation between REM and auditor responses, even after controlling for various audit-related risks. Thus, for auditors, REM appears to be primarily a ``people'' issue, as REM provides a negative signal about management.},

We show under further assumptions that before S observes his private information, the equilibrium whose partition has the greatest number of elements is Pareto-superior to all other equilibria, and that if agents coordinate on this equilibrium, R's equilibrium expected utility rises when agents' preferences become more similar. Since R bases his choice of action on rational expectations, this establishes a sense in which equilibrium signaling is more informative when agents' preferences are more similar.},

We hypothesize that conservatism makes it harder for managers to opportunistically downplay bad news and magnify good news when discussing current performance. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that UTM is negatively associated with several accounting conservatism proxies. Additionally, we hypothesize and find that this association is stronger for firms where managers have higher incentives to manipulate tone. In supplemental analyses, we find evidence to suggest that our results are not due to an endogenous relationship between conservatism and UTM. We also find that conservatism neither encourages downward tone management nor constrains managers from conveying real information about future good news. Together, our results suggest that accounting conservatism improves disclosure narratives.},

Specifically, the covariance between managerial tone and earnings performance is positive when earnings are below expectations, but negative when earnings meet or exceed expectations. We interpret our results to suggest that managers downplay positive changes in earnings to attenuate future growth expectations. We also find that tone concavity is significantly attenuated by managers' career concerns and accounting conservatism, but unrelated to litigation risk. Our results indicate that the effect of earnings performance on disclosure tone is complex and reflects managers' incentives to manage expectations.},

Second, the models all generate tests of low power for earnings management of economically plausible magnitudes (e.g., one to five percent of total assets). Third, all models reject the null hypothesis of no earnings management at rates exceeding the specified test-levels when applied to samples of firms with extreme financial performance. This result highlights the importance of controlling for financial performance when investigating earnings management stimuli that are correlated with financial performance.

This relationship is stronger in countries that are more stakeholder-oriented-i.e., in countries where CSR performance is more likely to affect firm financial performance. The relationship is also stronger for firms and countries with more opaque financial disclosure, suggesting that issuance of stand-alone CSR reports plays a role complementary to financial disclosure. These results hold after we control for various factors related to firm financial transparency and other potentially confounding institutional factors. Collectively, our findings have important implications for academics and practitioners in understanding the function of CSR disclosure in financial markets.},

Previous theoretical work on disclosure of new information by firms has demonstrated that releasing public information will often make all shareholders worse off, due to an adverse risksharing effect. This paper uses a general equilibrium model with endogenous information collection to demonstrate that there exists a policy of disclosure of information which makes all shareholders better off than a policy of no disclosure. The welfare improvement occurs because of explicit information cost savings and improved risk sharing. This provides a positive theory of precommitment to disclosure, because it will be unanimously voted for by stockholders and will also represent the policy that will maximize value ex ante. In addition, it provides a "missing link" in financial signalling models. Apart from the effects on information production analyzed in this paper, most existing financial signalling models are inconsistent with a firm taking actions which facilitate future signalling because release of the signal makes all investors worse off.},

  abstract = {Recent accounting research employs an asymmetric timeliness measure to test the hypothesis that reported accounting earnings are ``conservative.'' This research design regresses earnings on stock returns to examine whether ``bad'' news is incorporated into earnings on a more timely basis than ``good'' news. We identify properties of the asymmetric timeliness estimation procedure that will result in biases in the test statistics except under very restrictive conditions that are rarely met in typical empirical settings. Using data series that are devoid of asymmetric timeliness in reported earnings, we show how these biases result in evidence consistent with conservatism. We conclude that the biased test statistics inherent in the asymmetric timeliness research design preclude using this method to measure conservatism; that these biases are irresolvable as they originate in the test's specification; and that studies employing asymmetric timeliness tests cannot be interpreted as providing evidence of conservatism.},

We find that audit fees increase as BI decreases, but BI is not associated with financial misstatement or litigation. These findings are potentially consistent with auditors undertaking additional work in response to low BI, which, in turn, mitigates the risk of restatements and lawsuits. The likelihood of option backdating increases as BI decreases, consistent with the contention that auditors lacked incentives to prevent backdating. Finally, BI is increasing in future performance, which suggests that CEOs partially underpin the returns to high-integrity corporate cultures.},

The sole function of the corporation, suggestively, is conceived to be the making of profit for its stockholder-members, so that they are the ultimate beneficiaries of the business and of the activities of the persons by whom it is carried on. It is suggested that the legal recognition that there are other interests than those of the stockholders to be protected does not, however, necessarily give corporate managers the right to consider those interests, as it is possible to regard the managers as representatives of the stockholding interest only.},

A unique aspect of this study is that our respondents focus on mediumsize loans to private companies. In fact, more than 90 percent of the survey respondents primarily make credit decisions on loans between \$250 thousand and \$50 million. This is in contrast to prior archival research, which focuses primarily on very large loans to public firms or very small loans to private firms. We find that lenders in our sample distinguish among financial statements in terms of quality, including conservatism, primarily on the basis of accrual patterns and restatements. While this general result holds throughout our sample, financial statement quality is substantially more important for lenders making larger loans (over \$10 million) as compared to very small loans (under \$1 million). In addition, bank lenders are much more likely to respond to low-quality reporting with collateral and guarantee requirements than with an increase in the interest rate charged. This finding is consistent for lenders making both larger and smaller loans. Finally, despite concerns in the academic literature, bank lenders in our sample actually hold a neutral-to-positive view of recent changes in accounting standards. In addition, most do not support current efforts to exempt private companies from some accounting standards.},

We find that the rotation requirements in the third and fourth regimes decreased auditor-subjects' willingness to issue biased reports, relative to the two regimes in which rotation was not imposed. In these other two regimes, however, many manager-subjects voluntarily retained the same auditor-subjects over multi-periods. While the long running interactions between manager- and auditor-subjects resulted in more favorable reports by auditor-subjects (a lower level of independence), the established relationships also induced manager-subjects to make higher investments.},

The debt-contracting value captures the inherent ability of accounting numbers to predict credit quality. Using a large sample of private credit agreements, I hypothesize and find that a higher debt-contracting value gives rise to smaller ex post measurement errors in accounting numbers used in covenants, and thus borrowers and lenders are less likely to renegotiate financial covenants. This effect is stronger when the financial covenant intensity is higher. Consistent with the notion that renegotiation improves contracting efficiency by eliminating errors in financial covenants, I show that the distance of the covenant variable to its new contractual threshold better predicts a borrower's creditworthiness than does the distance to the original threshold absent the renegotiation.},

Second, accruals allow recognition of losses in an asymmetric timely manner. While these two roles imply different relations between individual accruals and operating cash flow news, prior research often focuses on the properties of aggregate accruals. We investigate the role of individual accrual components and identify asymmetry in the relation of investment with operating cash flow news as a confounding factor in prior research. We show that this investment factor operates through depreciation and amortization accruals, which typically account for the bulk of aggregate accruals. Our granular approach challenges prior evidence of variation in asymmetric timeliness with firm size and sheds new light on the role of diminishing working capital intensity in explaining an overall declining trend in the smoothing role of accruals.},

We show that managers' preferred bunching period depends on managers' strategy for trading in their firms' shares, managers' risk aversion, the risk premium the capital market attaches to firms' shares, and the size of managers' initial ownership stakes in their firms. We also study and characterize how the equilibrium prices of firms' shares vary over time and also how managers' optimal trading strategies vary with their most preferred ``bunching'' strategies. Several extensions confirm the robustness of the optimality of disclosure ``bunching.''},

Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that AFB firms have markedly lower conservative accounting than non-AFB firms. This result is robust to a battery of tests that account for bias from both observable and unobservable factors. We also find additional evidence to support key elements of our hypothesis. First, an examination of the relation between borrower-unfavorable renegotiations and covenant violations suggests that board representation allows lenders to renegotiate in a timelier manner based on private information. Second, an examination of the relation between covenant intensity and conservative accounting suggests that board representation decreases lenders' reliance on conservatism-facilitated control transfers. Finally, an analysis that uses relationship lending as an alternative proxy of lender monitoring suggests that it is lender monitoring, and not AFB per se, that reduces demand for conservative accounting.},

We analyze the short-run impact of this return to protectionism on the U.S. economy. Import and retaliatory tariffs caused large declines in imports and exports. Prices of imports targeted by tariffs did not fall, implying complete pass-through of tariffs to duty-inclusive prices. The resulting losses to U.S. consumers and firms that buy imports was \$51 billion, or 0.27\% of GDP. We embed the estimated trade elasticities in a general-equilibrium model of the U.S. economy. After accounting for tariff revenue and gains to domestic producers, the aggregate real income loss was \$7.2 billion, or 0.04\% of GDP. Import tariffs favored sectors concentrated in politically competitive counties, and the model implies that tradeable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties were the most negatively affected due to the retaliatory tariffs.

The theoretical basis of the tests is the "two-parameter" portfolio model and models of market equilibrium derived from the two-parameter portfolio model. We cannot reject the hypothesis of these models that the pricing of common stocks reflects the attempts of risk-averse investors to hold portfolios that are "efficient" in terms of expected value and dispersion of return. Moreover, the observed "fair game" properties of the coefficients and residuals of the risk-return regressions are consistent with an "efficient capital market"--that is, a market where prices of securities},

Second, firms in takeover friendly states have significantly higher leverage than their counterparts in restrictive law states. Third, bond issues are associated with negative average stock price reactions among firms in takeover-friendly states, but positive stock price reactions among firms in restrictive law states. Fourth, existing bond values increase, on average, upon the introduction of Business Combination antitakeover law. These results indicate that state antitakeover laws tend to decrease bond yields and increase bond values, which is the opposite of their effect on equity values. This, in turn, implies that state laws help mitigate the agency cost of debt by shielding bondholders from expropriation in takeovers. Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that the effect of antitakeover provisions on firm value must take into account the impacts of both bondholders and stockholders.},

In this paper, we first briefly retrace the milestones in readability research before the advent of this new paradigm, that we propose to call `Artificial Intelligence (AI) readability' since it results from the conjunction of two AI-connected domains: NLP and machine learning. We then describe in more detail some of the important studies within this new paradigm, before discussing three main issues of the field that need to be resolved in order to make significant advances and present interesting perspectives for future research.},

In this paper we investigate whether exposure to the self-interest model commonly used in economics alters the extent to which people behave in self-interested ways. The paper is organized into two parts. In the first, we report the results of several empirical studies-some our own, some by others -that suggest economists behave in more self-interested ways. By itself, this evidence does not demonstrate that exposure to the self-interest model causes more self-interested behavior, since it may be that economists were simply more self-interested to begin with, and this difference was one reason they chose to study economics. In the second part of the paper, we present preliminary evidence that exposure to the self-interest model does in fact encourage self-interested behavior.},

Dechow et al. (1998) also suggest that the strength of the relation between accruals and revenue changes relates to operating cycle length. Prior accrual models have not incorporated these theoretical relations. We show that incorporating cash-flow changes, serial correlation in cash-flow changes, and operating cycle length increases explanatory power of all accrual models considered (i.e., Jones 1991; Ball and Shivakumar 2006; McNichols 2002; Jeter and Shivakumar 1999). We find that incorporating these variables in accrual models also improves specification and power, aids detection of earnings management in AAER firms, and produces a nondiscretionary accrual estimate that better predicts future cash flows and earnings. These results suggest the importance of considering the economic role of accruals when predicting accruals.},

We find that the explanatory power of MD\&A accruals is higher for more readable 10-Ks, thereby providing evidence for the construct validity of the readability measures. To highlight the flexibility of the SVR method, we apply it to other dependent variables and disclosures. We find that MD\&A-based cash-flow forecasts produced by SVR predict next period's cash flows. We apply SVR to conference call transcripts and find accruals estimates have similar explanatory power to MD\&A accruals.

We conjecture that the reported earnings of smoothers that are socially responsible deviate less from their permanent earnings, thus their reported earnings are more value relevant. Our empirical tests show income-smoothing firms with higher corporate social responsibility (CSR) experience higher contemporaneous earnings-return relationship, greater Tobin's Q, and stronger current returnfuture earnings relationship. The results show that CSR is proved desirable as it adds a unique ``quality dimension'' to earnings attributes and is useful for firm valuation.},

Exogenous shocks (the passage of SFAS 131 and the SEC's short-selling pilot program) provide additional support for our findings. These shocks increased reporting transparency, reducing earnings management. More conditionally conservative firms, however, were only marginally affected, consistent with conditional conservatism already eliciting these transparency effects for them.},

In this paper, we further argue that increases in conservatism improve the firm information environment and lead to subsequent decreases in information asymmetries between firm insiders and outsiders. We predict and test if this decrease in information asymmetries manifests itself through: (a) a decrease in the bid\textendash ask spread and in stock-returns volatility, and (b) an improved information environment for financial analysts, leading to more precise and less dispersed forecasts, and to more analysts following the firm. Using a large US sample for the period 1977\textendash 2007 and several proxies for conservatism we find robust evidence consistent with our expectations. Our results are in line with conservatism being useful not only for debt-holders, but also for equity-holders.},

However, an emerging literature in finance and economics provides mixed findings and questions whether females in leadership roles significantly differ from their male counterparts. Building on this literature, we re-examine the link between the presence of female directors, gender biases, and financial statements quality. Using a large sample of UK firms we find that a larger percentage of women among independent directors is significantly associated with lower earnings management practices. However, we show that this relation disappears if we focus on firms that do not discriminate against women in the access to directorships. Finally, we provide evidence that gender biases are associated with lower earnings quality. We interpret our results as consistent with (1) prior evidence that males and females do not differ substantially when performing the same role in highly specialized positions, and with (2) discrimination being an important factor explaining the association between female directors and accounting quality.},

This article tries to clarify the situation, "mapping the territory" by classifying the main CSR theories and related approaches in four groups: (1) instrumental theories, in which the corporation is seen as only an instrument for wealth creation, and its social activities are only a means to achieve economic results; (2) political theories, which concern themselves with the power of corporations in society and a responsible use of this power in the political arena; (3) integrative theories, in which the corporation is focused on the satisfaction of social demands; and (4) ethical theories, based on ethical responsibilities of corporations to society. In practice, each CSR theory presents four dimensions related to profits, political performance, social demands and ethical values. The findings suggest the necessity to develop a new theory on the business and society relationship, which should integrate these four dimensions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Causal inference requires identification of a theoretically predicted causal mechanism in a research setting optimized to avoid endogenous causes and using a suitable statistical inference strategy. After briefly describing potential research design strategies, I analyze the frequency of causal studies published in leading business and economics journals. I identify causal studies by their abstract including an explicit reference to their causal nature and find that they are significantly more common in the areas of economics and finance compared to other business-oriented research disciplines like accounting. Also, the extent to which research designs are optimized for causal inference differs significantly between causal empirical archival studies in the area of financial accounting and finance. I discuss potential reasons for this gap and make some suggestions on how the demand for and supply of well-designed causal studies in the area of empirical archival financial accounting research might be increased. \'O 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For these firms, CSR increases lead to greater earnings management and lower quality of narrative disclosure. This suggests that demand-driven CSR practices may lead to unfavourable outcomes and, in particular, impair transparency.},

We find that a commitment to conservative reporting, defined as a requirement that firms disclose bad realizations of economic events, results in firm prices being higher, on average. Intuitively, in the absence of mandatory disclosure requirements, managers have incentives to disclose voluntarily information about good realizations and withhold information about bad realizations. Thus, a financial reporting system that requires timely reporting of low realizations results in lower uncertainty and higher firm value. Importantly, we interpret a commitment to conservative reporting to include not only reported earnings, but, more broadly, any mechanism that commits managers to disclose, such as required footnotes and explanations in corporate filings. Beyond a capital market setting, our model also applies to other adverse selection settings, including governance, litigation, and debt contracting, where timely disclosure of bad news improves efficiency.},

This relation is stronger when liquidity decreases around the filing of the financial statements, is stronger when firms have more outside monitors, and is weaker when firms have poor performance and greater earnings management. We also examine the relation between financial statement complexity and voluntary disclosure using two quasi-natural experiments. Employing a generalized difference-in-differences design, we find firms affected by the adoption of complex accounting standards (e.g., SFAS 133 and SFAS 157) increase their voluntary disclosure to a greater extent than unaffected firms.

We validate our measure by showing that it correctly identifies calls containing extensive conversations on risks that are political in nature, that it varies intuitively over time and across sectors, and that it correlates with the firm's actions and stock market volatility in a manner that is highly indicative of political risk. Firms exposed to political risk retrench hiring and investment and actively lobby and donate to politicians. These results continue to hold after controlling for news about the mean (as opposed to the variance) of political shocks. Interestingly, the vast majority of the variation in our measure is at the firm level rather than at the aggregate or sector level, in the sense that it is captured neither by the interaction of sector and time fixed effects nor by heterogeneous exposure of individual firms to aggregate political risk. The dispersion of this firm-level political risk increases significantly at times with high aggregate political risk. Decomposing our measure of political risk by topic, we find that firms that devote more time to discussing risks associated with a given political topic tend to increase lobbying on that topic, but not on other topics, in the following quarter.},

By taking the sustainability performance of the lending bank into account, I show that borrowers with strong sustainability performance pay lower loan spreads than borrowers with weak sustainability performance--however, only when the lending bank exhibits strong sustainability performance. The findings hold  across various methodological approaches including sample splits, interaction effects, propensity score matching, and identification using within-firm and within-bank differences as well as shocks in ESG performances while controlling for a wide range of possible confounding effects. I discuss three explanatory mechanisms for the relationship: improved credit risk, increase in trust due to similarity between banks and borrowers, and reputation risk. The study reveals that the relationship between sustainability performance and loan prices is driven by a premium in loan spreads for borrowers with weak sustainability performance, rather than a spread discount for strong sustainability performance. I show that the results are not driven by measurement error or selection of borrowers to banks. Consistent with the notion that the availability of sustainability information and scrutiny have been increasing, the results of this study reveal that the relationship between borrower sustainability performance and loan pricing is stronger in more recent years.},

The first voluntary disclosure measure is the count of 8-Ks, a proxy used in prior studies. The second and third are the count and word count of the 8-K items classified as voluntary (Items 2.02, 7.01, and 8.01) and the associated exhibits. The final voluntary disclosure measure is the count of the voluntary 8-K items and exhibits that include management guidance, conference calls, non-GAAP measures, or investor day disclosures. We document basic properties of these measures, including their cross-sectional and time-series correlations and persistence, and associations with firm-level characteristics. We show that, although the four measures are highly correlated, each captures unique aspects of firms' disclosures. Based on how the measures are constructed and supported by our findings, we contend that the word-count-based 8-K measure provides a superior proxy for firmlevel voluntary disclosure.},

An underlying assumption is that the commercial imperative is not the sole driver of CSR decision-making in private sector companies, but that the formal adoption and implementation of CSR by corporations could be associated with the changing personal values of individual managers. These values may find expression through the opportunity to exercise discretion, which may arise in various ways. It is suggested that in so far as CSR initiatives represent individuals' values, so the ``responsibility'' in evidence is less obviously ``corporate.'' Our emphasis on personal initiative is intended to counter a tendency to view the corporation as the agent, and may serve to remind us that individuals can, indeed, make a difference.},

The quantitative analysis explores the relation between the stock market reaction to earnings press releases and quantitative measures of style developed using elementary computer-based content analysis of a corpus of releases. Results suggest that tone influences investors' reactions. An explanation for this result is provided by prospect theory, which predicts that framing financial performance in positive terms causes investors to think about the results in terms of increases relative to reference points. Results also suggest that longer press releases reduce the market impact of unexpected earnings.},

  abstract = {We investigate whether accounting conservatism can be explained as a rational response to ambiguity. Decision analysis shows that decision rules that work well under ambiguity put greater weight on negative than on positive outcomes, i.e., exhibit caution. Accounting conservatism increases the timeliness of bad news that is more relevant under cautious decision rules and thereby helps corporate managers and investors implement them. We, therefore, hypothesize that firms facing greater ambiguity report more conservatively. We adopt two different measures to proxy for the firm-specific level of ambiguity. First, we identify firms pursuing the ``prospector'' versus ``defender'' business strategies. Compared with defenders, who focus on utilizing existing resources, prospectors actively create their future by seeking new business opportunities and thus face greater ambiguity. Second, we conduct an additional set of tests based on environmental scanning, which reduces ambiguity. Both sets of results suggest that firms facing greater ambiguity report more conservatively.},

ABTONE has a positive stock return effect at the earnings announcement and a delayed negative reaction in the one and two quarters afterward.

Appearances of target executives are associated with a negative market reaction which is attributed to retention of these executives. We also identify a negative relation between textual sentiment and market reaction consistent with a response to higher levels of information asymmetry. Greater quantitative information, however, is positively related to the market reaction of M\&A calls. We develop an M\&A motive dictionary to identify financial and strategic content within call transcripts. Consistent with prior literature on merger motivation, deals with more finance (strategy) oriented words have a higher (lower) market reaction.

Specifically, we explore the implications of regulations mandating the disclosure of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information in China, Denmark, Malaysia, and South Africa using differences-in-differences estimation with propensity score matched samples. We find that relative to propensity score matched control firms, treated firms significantly increased disclosure following the regulations. We also find increased likelihood by treated firms of voluntarily receiving assurance to enhance disclosure credibility and increased likelihood of voluntarily adopting reporting guidelines that enhance disclosure comparability. These results suggest that even in the absence of a regulation that mandates the adoption of assurance or specific guidelines, firms seek the qualitative properties of comparability and credibility. Instrumental variables analysis suggests that increases in sustainability disclosure driven by the regulation are associated with increases in firm valuations, as reflected in Tobin's Q. Collectively, the evidence suggest that current efforts to increase transparency around organizations' impact on society are effective at improving disclosure quantity and quality as well as corporate value.},

These increases are incremental to those found in control firms that face similar pressures but whose states did not pass antitakeover laws. We do not find comparable changes in ATLR for firms with higher agency costs of equity. In contrast to the observed increases in ATLR, we find no change in the short-window information content of earnings announcements.

However, future theoretical, methodological, and empirical research will be necessary to fill in the gaps in knowledge. The primary strength of thematic analysis of accounting narratives is its ability to identify the motivations and concerns of accounting communicators. The importance of readability research is highlighted by the fact that readability indexes could furnish objective benchmarks against which to measure the readability of accounting narratives.},

We control for fixed year effects, therefore our results are unlikely to be affected by the increase in concentration due to Andersen's demise contemporaneous with an increase in audit quality because of regulatory measures such as SOX. Our results are robust to alternative concentration and audit quality measures, and several sensitivity tests attempting to rule out omitted variables correlated with client firms' MSA location or attributes of clients and auditors. Our results are also robust to controls for endogeneity between audit market concentration and audit quality. Our evidence therefore supports the Government Accountability Office (2003, 2008) conclusions that increased audit market concentration is not currently a cause for concern.},

Less than ten percent of our large-surprise firms published quantitative earnings or sales forecasts, while 50 percent of the firms kept silent. Firms facing earnings disappointments were more likely to make a disclosure, and larger disappointments were preceded more often by "harder' (more quantitative and earnings-related) warnings. We found the likelihood of warnings to be positively associated with firm size, the existence of a previous forecast, and membership in a high technology industry. Finally, warnings tend to be issued for permanent earnings disappointments, while transitory disappointments are more likely to occur without prior warning.},

We show that during periods of suspicious accounting, firms hire and invest excessively, while managers exercise options. When the misreporting is detected, firms shed labor and capital and productivity improves. Our firm-level results hold both before and after the market crash of 2000.

Further, I document that firms with higher BSC passed liquidity shocks with lower reductions in investment, employment and productivity. Overall, BSC benefited both share- and debtholders. I identify two channels through which BSC-firms performed better during the crisis: the informational and cushioning roles. I document that high BSC-firms raised more capital and obtained lower cost of debt, due to the former role and reduced earnings volatility and experienced less assets write-downs, due to the latter. Additionally, I conduct an out of sample test exploiting Great Depression setting and also find that high BSC-firms outperformed low BSC-firms.},

We predict that changes in lending standards affect the accounting conservatism of bank-dependent firms. Using (i) a natural experiment that leads to certain banks tightening lending standards for plausibly exogenous reasons and (ii) time series variation in economy-wide bank lending standards, we find that borrowers increase their asymmetric timely loss recognition in response to the tightening of lending standards. Further, riskier borrowers, borrowers less likely to violate loan covenants, and borrowers whose banks tighten lending standards to a greater extent display larger increases in conservatism following the tightening of lending standards. These results suggest that borrowers internalize the costs and benefits of increasing conservatism. Finally, borrowers do not seem to decrease conservatism immediately after the lending standards are loosened. Overall, our results illuminate a commonly observed banking phenomenon that can influence firms' incentives to recognize losses, suggesting that developments in the banking sector can shape the information produced by firms in the real sector.},

We content analyze more than 100,000 disclosure reports by management, analysts, and news reporters (i.e., business press) in constructing firm-specific disclosure measures that are quantitative and amenable to replication. We expect credibility and timeliness differences in the disclosures by source, which would translate into differential cost of capital effects. We find that when content analysis indicates favorable disclosurs, the firm's risk, as proxied by the cost of capital, stock return volatility, and analyst forecast dispersion, declines significantly. In contrast, unfavorable disclosures are accompanied by significant increases in risk measures. Analysis of disclosures by source\textemdash corporations, analysts, and the business press\textemdash reveals that negative disclosures from business press sources result in increased cost of capital and return volatility, and favorable reports from business press reduce the cost of capital and return volatility.},

Our empirical tests are consistent with our proposition that information asymmetry is significantly positively related to conservatism after controlling for other demands for conservatism. Further, our tests are more consistent with our prediction that changes in information asymmetry between equity investors lead to changes in conservatism than the FASB's proposition that conservatism produces information asymmetry among equity investors. An important implication is that, if the FASB was successful in meeting its stated goal of eliminating conservatism, then it would increase information asymmetry between investors, not reduce it. This outcome is inconsistent with the objectives of the Securities Acts.},

In appropriate women's speech, strong expression of feeling is avoided, expression of uncertainty is favored, and means of expression in regard to subject-matter deemed 'trivial' to the 'real' world are elaborated. Speech about women implies an object, whose sexual nature requires euphemism, and whose social roles are derivative and dependent in relation to men. The personal identity of women thus is linguistically submerged; the language works against treatment of women, as serious persons with individual views.},

By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. Relations to other theories, phenomena, and problems are sketched.},

The language of deceptive executives exhibits more references to general knowledge, fewer nonextreme positive emotions, and fewer references to shareholder value.In addition, deceptive CEOs use significantly more extreme positive emotion and fewer anxiety words. Finally, a portfolio formed from firms with the highest deception scores from CFO narratives produces an annualized alpha of between -4\% and -11\%.},

However, all else does not stay constant because the manager's pay plan will change in response to changes in the accounting system. We show that under optimal contracting, more conservative accounting does not stifle innovation in organizations, but rather increases incentives for innovation, as long as conservatism reduces the risk of an overstatement.},

We observe that the newly required 8-K items constitute over half of all filings and that most firms disclose the required items within the new shortened period (four business days). We find that all disclosed items (old and new) are associated with abnormal volume and return volatility around both the event and the SEC filing dates, and some items have significant return drifts after the SEC filings. Surprisingly, we find that the information content of periodic reports has not diminished by the more expansive and timely 8-K disclosures under the new guidance, possibly indicating that investors may use periodic filings to interpret the effects of material events that had been disclosed earlier.},

These tests are opposite to the typical research design that analyzes cost of capital responses to disclosure changes. In reversing the tests and using an exogenous shock, we mitigate concerns about omitted variables in traditional cross-sectional disclosure studies. We estimate shocks to firms' betas around the Enron events and the ensuing transparency crisis. Our analysis shows that these beta shocks are associated with increased disclosure. Firms expand the number of pages of their annual 10-K filings, notably the sections containing the financial statements and footnotes. The increase in disclosure is particularly pronounced for firms that have positive cost of capital shocks and larger financing needs. We also find that firms respond with additional interim disclosures (e.g., 8-K filings) and that these disclosures are complementary to the 10-K disclosures. Finally, we show that firms' disclosure responses reduce firms' costs of capital and hence the impact of the transparency crisis.},

  abstract = {Using data from the EDGAR era, we find a significant market reaction surrounding quarterly periodic reports only when their filing coincides with the first public disclosure of earnings, although that for 10-K reports is not subsumed by earn ings releases. However, after eliminating incidence of concurrent earnings releases, the 10-K market reaction is restricted to a quarter of the reports that are filed around calendar quarter-ends. The calendar quarter-end price and volume effects are unrelated to the filing of periodic reports and are not explained by self-selection. However, while the quarter-end volume reaction is indistinguishable between filers and non-filers, we find an incremental price reaction to 10-K filings at calendar quarter-ends in recent times. We provide evidence that the calendar-time effect is partially due to an intra industry information transfer that is a function of the incidence of 10-K reports at quarter-ends. Finally, equity analyst reactions are muted around periodic filings, with no evidence that they contribute to quarter-end information transfer.},

The third and fourth parts review the cross-country and single country audit quality research from the perspectives of audit demand, audit supply as well as the effects of regulatory intervention. The results indicate that, among the papers reviewed, CAR accepted most papers for cross-country research on audit quality. Whereas the single country research on audit quality appears more often in JAPP, CAR, AJPT and TAR. In addition, among the single country research, China audit market studies are ranked number one followed by Taiwan studies. As to the research topics, most cross-countries studies focus on the topics related to audit demand. Many single country studies, however, either examine the effects of the regulation changes or take advantage of the unique data set resulting from specific requirements in a given country to test the audit theory. This study concludes by assessing the challenges and limitations of cross-country research, analyzing the factors that make single country research popular, and providing future research avenues in audit quality for Asian countries.},

Repetitive disclosures refer to the extent that content in the MD\&A is repeated from the audited financial statement notes. I empirically analyze repetitive disclosures in the MD\&A section of the 10-K filing, and find that firms tend to use more repetitive disclosures when firms have a new CEO, a high level of new disclosures in the notes, issued equity, and have missed the prior year's earnings benchmark. These findings suggest that not all managers use repetitive disclosures to simply obfuscate disclosures. Rather, some managers use repetitive disclosures to emphasize firm-specific events, consistent with the succession hypothesis. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) states that repetitive disclosures are uninformative and that such disclosures decrease the informativeness of other disclosures in the MD\&A. Casting doubt on the SEC's comments, in my primary analyses, I find that repetitive disclosures are informative to investors; this result is stronger for individual investors. Overall, my results suggest that repetitive disclosures are informative, and such disclosures may be effective tools for providing information to investors.},

For a variety of material events, firms are required to issue a Form 8-K, but 37\% of the time also voluntarily issue a press release concerning the same event. Using textual analysis, I find that firms are more likely to issue a press release if the underlying 8-K tone is positive, and that tonal differences between the 8-K and the press release are driven in part by quotes from firm officers. I also find economically significant responses in firms' stock returns to tonal language in the 8-K, as well as to tonal differences between the two disclosures. To verify whether my strategy of comparing the press release against the 8-K is isolating the effects of promotional language or additional information, I test and find evidence of an initial positive reaction but a subsequent negative drift from positively toned press releases. This evidence implies that investors may have initially responded to both information and spin. Nominating investor inattention as a possible mechanism for overreaction, I use novel search traffic micro-data from the SEC EDGAR website and detect lower 8-K search intensity in the presence of a press release. Together, my results are consistent with some investors overestimating the degree of substitutability between the two disclosures and thus failing to readjust expectations accordingly.},

News coverage related to wars and government policy explains most of the time variation in risk premia our measure identifies.

Exploiting commonalities in teaching schedules of school teachers in Texas to identify peer groups, we find that refinancing activity among teachers' peers increases their likelihood of refinancing by 20.7\%. The effect of peers increases with the potential savings realized upon refinancing and is stronger among younger teachers. Peers also affect teachers' choice of lender.

Anecdotal evidence and surveys suggest that managers believe that missing an earnings target can cause stock-price drops (Graham et al. 2006). Empirical studies corroborate this notion (Skinner and Sloan 2002; Lopez and Rees 2002). Thus, a missed target could benefit an executive via lower strike price on subsequent option grants. Prior option grant studies explore only general downward earnings management (Balsam et al. 2003; Baker et al. 2003), but our study is the first to explore whether option grants encourage missed earnings targets. Indeed, if missed targets drive the prior results, then the literature has failed to document an important negative outcome of stock-option incentives. We use quarterly and annual data for fixed-date options granted after firms announce they have missed earnings targets. We find that firms that miss earnings targets have larger and more valuable subsequent grants. Further, we find that the likelihood of missing earnings targets for firms that manage earnings downward increases with stock-option grants. To control for the possibility that firms miss earnings targets for operational reasons, we only include firms that likely managed earnings downward (Dechow et al. 1995; Phillips et al. 2003). Backdating or opportunistic timing of grants cannot explain our results because we include only fixed-date grants. While many studies explicitly consider whether and why managers meet or beat earnings targets, ours is the first study to find that some managers may seek to miss earnings targets (Burgstahler and Dichev 1997).},

To test our hypotheses, we apply textual analysis to our data on firms listed in the STOXX Europe 600 for the period 2008\textendash 2016. Our investigation of topic-specific CSR disclosure indicates that when firms shifted from voluntary to mandatory reporting, following the announcement of Directive 2014/95/EU, the association between their share price and CSR disclosure became significantly negative. For the period before the announcement, this relationship is either positive or statistically insignificant. We also show that the institutional environment can impact this relationship in four distinct ways: the level of CSR awareness, the level of employee protection, the degree of enforcement and the strength of the legal environment. We find that the first two have a negative impact on the incremental value relevance of specific CSR disclosure, whereas the last two have a positive impact. Lastly, our results also indicate that the magnitude of (a) the relationship between a firm's CSR disclosure and its value and (b) the impact that the firm's institutional environment has on this relationship depends on the specific CSR topics.},

Analysis of previous empirical investigations located 16 language features that had consistently been shown to indicate communicator gender and these were tested within the framework of the four dimensions of intercultural style proposed by Gudykunst and Ting-Toomey (1988): direct versus indirect, succinct versus elaborate, personal versus contextual, and instrumental versus affective. Study 1 provided preliminary evidence supporting the hypothesized language-feature-by-dimension relationships (e.g., male directives were rated more direct and female uncertainty verbs more indirect). In Study 2, respondents rated multiple exemplars of the 16 language features, as well as 16 contrasting foil sentences, on all four dimensions, finding that nearly all of the variables fell on the hypothesized intercultural dimensions. In Study 3, respondents rated four sets of naturally occurring target sentences and matching foil sentences, representing all language variables, on their appropriate intercultural dimensions in order to establish dimensional polarity. Results across the three studies supported the hypothesized language feature-by-stylistic dimension relationships for 15 of the 16 variables: The 6 male language features were rated as more direct, succinct, personal, and instrumental, whereas 9 of the 10 female features were perceived as more indirect, elaborate, and affective. The findings demonstrate that gender preferences for language use function in ways that are consistent with stylistic preferences that distinguish national cultures.},

To address the discourses surrounding the evolution of Chapter 1, we introduce the concept of ``living law'' from sociological jurisprudence into accounting scholarship. We first trace the role of stewardship/accountability in the evolution\textemdash from antiquity to the present day\textemdash of the living law of accounting. We then explore the origin, nature, and implications\textemdash from a living law perspective\textemdash of the moral traditions associated with stewardship/accountability. Our analysis suggests that stewardship has been, and continues to be, embedded in the living law of accounting\textemdash notwithstanding the formal pronouncements of standard setters. We also examine the social accounting project from a living law perspective and we suggest that such an analysis provides new possibilities for addressing core social accounting concerns. We conclude by arguing that, particularly in light of the far reaching impact of the neoliberal agenda, there is an urgent need for scholars in both contemporary ``social'' and ``mainstream'' accounting to recognize and build upon their shared living law heritage rooted in the age-old traditions of stewardship/accountability.},

  abstract = {Using a sample of over 5,000 debt issues, I test whether firms with more extensive use of covenants in their public debt contracts exhibit timelier recognition of economic losses in accounting earnings. Covenants govern the transfer of decision-making and control rights from shareholders to bondholders when a company approaches financial distress and thereby limit managers' abilities to expropriate bondholder wealth. Covenants are expected to constrain managerial opportunism, however, only if the accounting system recognizes economic losses in earnings in a timely fashion. Thus, the demand for timely loss recognition should increase with a contract's reliance on covenants. Consistent with this conjecture, I find evidence that reliance on covenants in public debt contracts is positively associated with the degree of timely loss recognition. I also find evidence that the presence of prior private debt mitigates this relationship.},

Together, our findings suggest firms became more reliant on 8Ks to convey general types of information after the 2004 regulation, rather than primarily negative news, which reduces their incentives to issue guidance.},

The model assumes that the present value of dividends per share (dps) determines price, but it does not restrict how the dps-sequence is expected to evolve. All of these aspects of the model contrast sharply with the standard (Gordon/Williams) text-book approach, which equates the growth rates of expected eps and dps and fixes the growth rate and the payout rate. Though the constant growth model arises as a peculiar special case, the analysis in this paper rests on more general principles, including dividend policy irrelevancy. A second key result inverts the valuation formula to show how one expresses cost-of-capital as a function of the forward eps to price ratio and the two measures of growth in expected eps. This expression generalizes the text-book equation in which cost-of-capital equals the dps-yield plus the growth in expected eps.},

In addition, our study demonstrates that audit committee connectedness through director networks moderates the negative effect of board interlocks to misstating firms on financial reporting quality. We conduct several tests to address identification concerns and find similar results.

The present paper addresses the question how this decision was made by the boards and why stewardship was not identified as a separate objective. Drawing on Flyvbjerg's work on rationality and power, the paper analyses the practices of standardsetting in the specific case of the framework revision. The qualitative empirical study is based on the material which is publicly available from the due process of the IASB and FASB and also builds on interviews with board members, staff members and constituents. This paper finds that the decision usefulness programme, developed in the US in the 1970s, was the body of knowledge which primarily shaped and limited the debates during the framework revision. While decision usefulness was taken for granted by all participants, even by those who were arguing for a separate stewardship objective, no alternative rationality or programme associated with stewardship was discussed in the standard-setting arena. The paper also shows that a ``mundane'' organisational structure put the staff in a crucial position to influence board debates and sheds light on how disciplinary and self-disciplinary techniques affected board members' decision-making in the framework project.},

Specifically, we show that, all else equal, financial analysts announce lower earnings per share expectations for firms with more humble CEOs. This expectation discount sets the stage for those firms to meet or beat analysts' expectations resulting in improved market performance for firms with humble CEOs.

Using a difference- in-differences analysis, we find that the increase in stakeholder orientation leads to a decrease in accounting conservatism. In other words, as firms shift attention to stakeholder interests, stakeholders become less concerned about shareholder expropriation and thus demand less conservatism. Cross-sectional analyses show stronger effects for firms with ex-ante higher stakeholder demand for conservatism due to greater transient institutional ownership and lower liquidation values and for firms with more powerful employees who have the ability to influence a firm's accounting policy ex-ante. Further, we find the reduction in risk taking and the appointment of stakeholder-oriented directors as two potential channels through which the adoption of constituency statutes decreases stakeholders' demand for conservatism.},

In addition, despite the less favorable terms offered by existing creditors, borrowers rarely switch lenders following a violation.},

We describe the econometric problems associated with measuring bundled forecast news and, in particular, provide evidence that the measurement error in the traditional calculation of forecast news is material and is systematically associated with variables frequently studied in forecast-related research. We illustrate an application of conditional expectations to overcome these problems. Finally, we offer guidance and caveats to researchers considering the use of this method in the future.},

Using both general-purpose and context-specific text dictionaries to quantify tone we find that plaintiffs target more optimistic statements in their lawsuits and that sued firms' earnings announcements are unusually optimistic relative to other firm experiencing similar economic circumstances. These findings are consistent with optimistic language increasing litigation risk. In addition, we find incrementally greater litigation risk when managers are both unusually optimistic and engage in abnormal selling. This finding suggests that firms can mitigate litigation risk by ensuring that optimistic statements are not contradicted by insider selling. Finally, we find that insider selling is associated with litigation risk only when contemporaneous disclosures are unusually optimistic.},

The papers investigate the multidimensional nature of social capital, particularly in its cognitive and structural dimensions, at both micro and macro levels and address socially responsible behavior from a multi-stakeholder perspective. They also address the instrumental, normative, and intrinsic factors that influence a firm's decision to be responsible to all stakeholders instead of just shareholders. They adopt methodological approaches more common to the social capital literature--in which agent's motivations are considered more complex than mere self-interest aimed at maximizing payoffs--from psychological game theory to behavioral and experimental analysis.},

Our findings support the notion that managers believe in the existence of investor inattention and strategically report negative news after trading hours. These results particularly apply to public firms, where equity market pressures provide stronger incentives to mitigate market reaction to news by exploiting investor inattention. Further analysis of the market reaction to strategic disclosure uncovers no evidence of investor inattention, consistent with market efficiency.

We find that language sentiment influences investors' judgments when readability is low, but not when readability is high. Specifically, when readability is low, disclosures couched in positive language lead to higher earnings judgments for less sophisticated investors, but lower earnings judgments for more sophisticated investors. These findings show that the main effects of readability and language sentiment documented in prior studies have boundary effects, and may reverse when both variables are jointly considered along with investor sophistication.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, I attempt a taxonomy of the extant accounting literature on disclosure: that is, a categorization of the various models of disclosure in the literature into well-integrated topics. With regard to the taxonomy, I suggest three broad categories of disclosure research in accounting. The first category, which I dub ``association-based disclosure'', is work that studies the effect of exogenous disclosure on the cumulative change or disruption in investors' individual actions, primarily through the behavior of asset equilibrium prices and trading volume. The second category, which I dub ``discretionary-based disclosure'', is work that examines how managers and/or firms exercise discretion with regard to the disclosure of information about which they may have knowledge. The third category, which I dub ``efficiency-based disclosure'', is work that discusses which disclosure arrangements are preferred in the absence of prior knowledge of the information, that is, preferred unconditionally. Then, in the final section of the paper, I recommend information asymmetry reduction as one potential starting point for a comprehensive theory of disclosure. That is, I recommend information asymmetry reduction as a vehicle to integrate the efficiency of disclosure choice, the incentives to disclose, and the endogeneity of the capital market process as it involves the interactions among individual and diverse investors.},

Our results are robust to identification strategies addressing the endogeneity of CEO inside debt and to alternative measures of accounting conservatism.},

The result is robust to a battery of sensitivity tests and more prominent for firms with lower analyst coverage. Further analyses reveal that upward earnings management by mandatory disclosure firms is more likely to be caught after the policy.

Part I examines alternative explanations for conservatism in accounting and their implications for accounting regulators. Conservatism is defined as the differential verifiability required for recognition of profits versus losses. Its extreme form is the traditional conservatism adage: "anticipate no profit, but anticipate all losses." Despite criticism, conservatism has survived in accounting form many centuries and appears to have increased in the last 30 years. FASB attempts to ban conservatism existed and prospered for so long are likely to fail and product unintended consequences. Successful elimination of conservatism will change managerial behavior and impose significant costs on investors and the economy in general. Similarly, researchers and regulators who proposed the inclusion of capitalized unverifiable future cash flows in financial reports should consider the costs generated by their proposal's effect on managerial behavior.},

The 1978 paper helped generate the positive accounting literature which offers an explanation of accounting practice, suggests the importance of contracting costs, and has led to the discovery of some previously unknown empirical regularities. The 1979 paper produced a methodological debate that has not been very productive. This paper attempts to remove some common misconceptions about methodology that surfaced in the debate. It also suggests ways to improve positive research in accounting choice. The most important of these improvements is tighter links between the theory and the empirical tests. A second suggested improvement is the development of models that recognize the endogeneity among the variables in the regressions. A third improvement is reduction in measurement errors in both the dependent and independent variables in the regressions.},

Results indicate that individual manager fixed effects explain a statistically and economically significant proportion of the cross-sectional variation in AQ, which is comparable to that of firm fixed effects. Variation in managerial attributes that impact AQ is applied consistently as firms switch manager-type. Using a setting of exogenous CEO turnover, I find managerial idiosyncrasies impact AQ and are not merely a reflection of firms actively choosing managers with a desired combination of managerial attributes that, in turn, impact the variability of accruals. Overall, my study underscores the importance of individual managers in the determination of AQ.},

This paper investigates the determinants of accounting conservatism using accrual-based measures and data from 2001 to 2006 in China. We find that a higher degree of leverage, lower level of control of ultimate shareholders and lower level of management ownership lead to more conservative financial reporting. We also find that political concerns and pressures among state-owned enterprises are greater than those among non-state owned enterprises, which leads to more conservative financial reporting among the former. However, a decrease in such concerns leads to a decrease in accounting conservatism. Overall, we find that among the determinants of conservatism in China, debt is the most important, followed by ownership, and that board has little influence.},

Firms with extremely low or extremely high CSR are subject to a higher CDF. The results also suggest that the optimal CSR level for small firms is higher than that for large firms. This study is the first to document a U-shaped relationship between CSR and CDF and also the first to investigate this relationship within an emerging market context.},

Using the results of others and new studies of their own, they show that economics students are more likely to free ride or defect from coalitions. In addition, they present survey results that indicate lowered cooperation by students after exposure to the principles of economics course and other surveys that find that professional econ- omists report less charitable giving. This evidence is consistent with the proposition that studying economics alters how students play structured games and answer surveys about cooperativeness. How- ever, we disagree with the additional conclusion that, as Frank, Gilovich and Regan (1993, p. 159) put it in their article, "exposure to the self-interest model commonly used in economics alters the extent to which people behave in self-interested ways." In fact, the evidence in this paper implies that even if undergraduate students of economics display uncooperative behavior in specialized games or surveys, their "real-world" behavior is actually substantially more cooperative than that of their counterparts studying other subjects.},
