\section{Introduction}
% Motivation
\noindent We define and provide evidence of narrative conservatism. We define narrative conservatism as \textit{narratives that reflect bad news in a more timely, news-consistent and complete manner than good news}. Our definition builds on \citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}, and extends the notion of accounting conservatism to narrative disclosure. Narrative conservatism is of interest for at least two reasons. First, it completes our understanding of accounting conservatism. Financial reporting consists both of recognition and disclosure, and thus, the extant knowledge of conditional and unconditional conservatism, which manifest through recognition, is a partial view of conservatism in accounting, which we extend by studying the role of narratives. Second, narrative disclosure takes up a dominant space in corporate filings.\footnote{For example, Apple Inc.'s 2019 Annual Report consists of 64 pages: 3 are numerical summaries of the financial statements, and 15 of other tables and figures. The remaining pages are narratives, including risk factors, management discussion and analysis (MD\&A), notes to financial statements (NFS), among other things. Over the past 20 years, the average number of pages in annual reports devoted to footnotes and MD\&A has quadrupled \cite{eyPointNowTime2012}.} Investors' perceptions of firm performance and their subsequent decision-making processes are influenced by narratives \citeyear<e.g., Li>{liTextualAnalysisCorporate2011}. Therefore, there is need for further research on the properties of narrative disclosure and its economic implications. 

Consistent with this view, \citeA[p. 243]{kothariManagersWithholdBad2009} note that while prior research focuses on conservative \textit{recognition}, there is little evidence on conservative \textit{disclosure}. Guay and Verrecchia \citeyear[pp. 73-74]{guayConservativeDisclosure2018} call for more studies to focus on conservative reporting through narrative disclosure because ``a commitment to timely disclosure of bad news need not come exclusively through financial statement recognition.'' Despite these calls for further research, we know little about whether narrative disclosure is conservative, or whether and how narrative conservatism interacts with other forms of conservatism.

% Theory
\begin{comment}
	Prior studies distinguish between recognition and disclosure. Recognition is the depictions in numbers on the face of the financial statements, and disclosure is commonly viewed as the display in the notes and supporting schedules that accompany financial statements \cite{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007}. The two formats of financial reporting are subject to different reporting requirements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) explicitly specifies a set of recognition criteria while allowing for more flexibility in disclosure \cite{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}. This flexibility paves the way for the supplementary role of disclosure---disclosing information that cannot be recognized due to the failure to meet one or more of the recognition criteria. The other explanatory role of disclosure is to provide detailed background information of recognized numbers in financial statements \cite[par. 7]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}. 
\end{comment}

An ample literature studies conditional and unconditional conservatism, concentrating on properties of income statement and balance sheet items. Conditional conservatism captures the asymmetric response of earnings to positive and negative economic news \cite{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}, and unconditional conservatism manifests as a systematic understatement of net book value of assets due to predetermined aspects of the accounting process \cite<e.g.,>[]{beaverConditionalUnconditionalConservatism2005}. We add to this literature by studying conservatism in narrative disclosure. The existence of narrative conservatism is not clear ex-ante. Prior literature outlines managerial incentives both to disclose and withhold bad news \cite{healyInformationAsymmetryCorporate2001, kothariManagersWithholdBad2009, baoManagersDiscloseWithhold2019}. These incentives may also influence managers' decisions on whether, and to what extent, narrative disclosure responds to good and bad news asymmetrically. Given this, whether \textit{on average} firms respond to good and bad news asymmetrically in narrative disclosure is an empirical question of interest.

To conceptualize narrative conservatism, we build on fundamental properties of accounting information and their definitions. In particular, we focus on whether narratives respond to economic losses (bad news) in a more timely, news-consistent and complete manner than to economic gains (good news). Timeliness implies that disclosure is made \textit{in time} to be able to influence users' decisions. News-consistency implies that disclosure agrees with the underlying economic event in content sentiment. Completeness implies that disclosure includes all necessary information for a user to understand the underlying economic event. 

% Research Design
	% a. Corpora
We empirically examine narrative conservatism using 8-K filings as our main corpora. The 8-K form is a report that must be filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within a short time period to notify investors about material events or changes in the company. Compared to other corporate disclosure channels such as media, press releases, conference calls, annual or quarterly reports, the 8-K form is a more appropriate corpora to study the asymmetric behavior of narrative disclosure in response to good and bad news for the following reasons. First, 8-Ks are timelier than periodic reports because they are required to be filed within days of the news.\footnote{In contrast, annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) filings often report on news with several months delay, given their fixed schedule. Consider, for example, news that take place in January for a firm with a December fiscal year end. Even if management aims to report in a timely manner, news will not be conveyed in the quarterly and annual report until April and January of the following year, respectively.} Second, 8-Ks convey more credible information compared to social media and business press because their content is subject to SEC scrutiny. Third, because 8-Ks only report a series of material corporate events that are predefined by the SEC, by using 8-Ks as our main corpora, we can focus on the corporate events that have moderate impact and accurately identify the topic of the event by 8-K items.

	% b. Proxies
We evaluate timeliness by the reporting time lag, which is the number of days between the news release date and the disclosure filing date. We identify a date as the news release date if the change in daily returns on that date is three times larger than the firm's annual average change in daily returns in absolute magnitude. We define news-consistency as the degree to which firms respond to good news with positive tone and to bad news with negative tone, and we measure it by the marginal change of narrative tone in response to news. The marginal change depicts how much narrative tone changes given one unit change in stock returns. We proxy completeness by the number of total words, total number of 8-K filings, total number of 8-K items, total number of 8-K exhibits and graphs. 
Overall, we posit that if narratives are conservative, they should have shorter reporting time lag, greater marginal change of tone, more words, filings, items, exhibits and graphs in response to bad news than to good news. We follow \citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997} and use stock returns as our main proxy for news.

% Data and Findings
	% Main results
We retrieve 8-K filings from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.  Our final 8-K sample contains 83,464 firm-day observations from 6,477 unique firms from 1993 to 2020.\footnote{Since the SEC adopted the rule of electronic submission for corporate filings in 1993, data coverage in the first year of EDGAR implementation is low \cite{gaoInformingMarketEffect2020}. We repeat our main analyses using data from 1994 onward, and our main results hold.} We find that 8-Ks are filed faster (with shorter time lag), have greater marginal change of tone, and contain more words, filings, items, exhibits and graphs in response to bad news than to good news, consistent with narrative disclosure being conservative.
    % Robustness
We conduct a battery of robustness checks. First, to ensure that our asymmetric timeliness results are not specific to the novel 8-K reporting time lag definition, we follow \citeA{carterRelevanceForm8K1999}, \citeA{niessnerStrategicDisclosureTiming2015} and \citeA{chapmanInformationOverloadDisclosure2019} to define the 8-K time lag as the number of days between the 8-K reporting period date and the 8-K filing date.\footnote{All filings in EDGAR have two dates: filing date and reporting period date. Filing date is the date when the report is filed to EDGAR, and reporting period date is the end date of reporting period of the filing (see https://www.sec.gov/about/webmaster-faq.htm).} Second, to ensure that our results are not only driven by the a priori bad news items that are expected to be more narratively conservative by nature, we eliminate \textit{a priori} bad news 8-K items following \citeA{segalAreManagersStrategic2016}. Third, to ensure that our 8-K reporting time lag strictly proxy for timeliness of narrative disclosure, we exclude 8-K days that contain quarterly or annual financial statements following \citeA{segalAreManagersStrategic2016}. Our main findings hold under these three robustness checks.

	% Additional Analyses
We perform four sets of additional analyses. First, we investigate whether narrative conservatism is present in other disclosures. Specifically, we test if narratives in quarterly reports, i.e., 10-Q filings, are conservative. We choose 10-Qs because they contain sections such as risk factors, managerial discussions and analysis (MD\&A) and notes to financial statements (NFS), where managers discuss the risks and opportunities of the business. Thus, they offer more flexibility and diversity in terms of linguistic tone and length compared to 8-Ks, which are more standardized. However, due to the periodicity of 10-Qs, they are not as timely as 8-Ks in response to unforeseen corporate events. This means that the reporting time lag of 10-Qs does not strictly proxy for narrative reporting timeliness. Therefore, we only study asymmetric tone consistency and completeness in 10-Q filings. We hypothesize and find evidence that 10-Qs are more news-consistent and lengthier in response to bad news than good news, consistent with 10-Q narratives being conservative. To ensure that our 10-Q results are not driven by boilerplate disclosure, we examine how narrative conservatism varies in MD\&A as compared with the notes to financial statements (NFS) using 10-Qs. We conjecture that narratives in MD\&A are more conservative because they contain less boilerplate than the NFS \cite{secFinancialReportingManual2019}. Our results are consistent with this prediction. 

Second, we examine whether narrative conservatism differs between voluntary and mandatory disclosure. Prior research suggests that managers have more freedom to determine the timing, content and rhetoric in voluntary disclosure than in mandatory disclosure \cite{segalAreManagersStrategic2016}. Thus, we expect voluntary disclosure to be more conservative than mandatory disclosure. We classify voluntary and mandatory disclosure following the 8-K classification in \citeA{heMeasuringDisclosureUsing2020}. Consistent with our expectation, narrative conservatism is mainly driven by voluntary disclosure. 

Third, we study time trends in narrative conservatism for our full sample period (1995 to 2020). We find that asymmetric timeliness is pervasive in narratives. We also document asymmetric news-consistency and asymmetric completeness in narratives around the period of the financial crisis. Our evidence indicates that narrative conservatism has become a stable property of accounting narratives since then.

Fourth, we explore how narrative conservatism interacts with conditional conservatism and unconditional conservatism. Following \citeA{khanEstimationEmpiricalProperties2009}, we measure conditional conservatism with C\_SCORE. We use the natural logarithm of intangible assets (INTANQ) and R\&D expenses (XRDQ) to proxy for unconditional conservatism. We divide the full 8-K sample into high and low conditional (unconditional) subsamples based on the median of C\_SCORE (INTANQ and XRDQ). We find that narrative conservatism is more salient in firms with low (high) conditional (unconditional) conservatism, suggesting that narrative conservatism supplements conditional conservatism, and complements unconditional conservatism. 

%Fifth, firm characteristics
%We focus on four firm characteristics: firm size (SIZE), growth opportunities (MTB) and leverage (LEV) \cite{wattsConservatismAccountingPart2003, qiangEffectsContractingLitigation2007, khanEstimationEmpiricalProperties2009, garcialaraEconomicDeterminantsConditional2009} and proprietary costs \cite{verrecchiaDiscretionaryDisclosure1983, liImpactsProductMarket2010}. Following \citeA{harrisAssociationCompetitionManagers1998}, we measure proprietary costs by Herfindahl index. We divide the full 8-K sample into quintiles based on each firm characteristic and estimate our main model within each quintile.

%Sixth, we inspect whether and how managerial incentives affect narrative conservatism in three settings where managers have incentives to either disclose or withhold bad news. Prior studies document that when firms are undergoing a seasoned equity offering (SEO), managers have more incentives to withhold bad news \cite{teohEarningsManagementUnderperformance1998, langVoluntaryDisclosureEquity2000}. In contrast, when executives anticipate large stock option grants, managers have more incentives to disclose bad news \cite{yermackGoodTimingCEO1997, aboodyCEOStockOption2000}. We hypothesize and find evidence that the narrative disclosure of firms undergoing SEOs is less conservative, whereas that of firms issuing stock option grants is more conservative.

%Moreover, we examine how litigation risk affects narrative conservatism. Prior literature provides mixed evidence on whether litigation induces managers to disclose or withhold bad news. One the one hand firms tend to disclose bad news to reduce the probability of being sued for late disclosure or to minimize the resolution costs in case that the litigation is inevitable \cite<e.g.,>{skinnerWhyFirmsVoluntarily1994,skinnerEarningsDisclosuresStockholder1997}. On the other hand, firms withhold bad news given that bad news disclosure can trigger litigation \cite<e.g.,>{francisShareholderLitigationCorporate1994}. We find that firms with high litigation risk are less conservative compared to firms with low litigation risk in terms of disclosure completeness and news-consistency. Our finding echos Rogers and Van Buskirk's \citeyear{rogersShareholderLitigationChanges2009} that firms reduce disclosure to avoid litigation, and provides indirect evidence in line with  \citeA{francisShareholderLitigationCorporate1994}, that bad news disclosure may trigger litigation.

% Contribution
Our study contributes to the accounting literature in three main ways. First, we document the existence of narrative conservatism. Prior studies focus on two forms of conservatism in accounting recognition---the asymmetric earnings response to good and bad news and the understatement of net asset values \cite{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997, ballEarningsQualityUK2005, beaverConditionalUnconditionalConservatism2005}. We extend the notion of conservatism to the asymmetric narrative responses to good and bad news. We also document the relationship among narrative conservatism, conditional and unconditional conservatism, providing initial evidence that narrative conservatism supplements (complements) conditional (unconditional) conservatism.
% Second, we add to the literature on the interaction between recognition and disclosure \cite{aboodyRecognitionDisclosureOil1996, barthMarketEffectsRecognition2003, schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007}. We find that firms with high conditional conservatism tend to be more conservative in narratives as well, suggesting that recognition and disclosure are complements in financial reporting. 
Second, we provide novel evidence to the debate regarding whether managers withhold bad news. Prior research uses a wide variety of disclosure proxies to study managers' tendency to disclose bad news \cite{kasznikWarnNotWarn1995, kothariManagersWithholdBad2009, baoManagersDiscloseWithhold2019}. Using novel proxies for disclosure, our results indicate that firms \textit{on average} disclose bad news in a more timely, news-consistent and complete manner than good news. Third, we contribute to the broader literature on the informativeness of SEC filings. A stream of literature studies the market reactions to 8-Ks \cite{carterRelevanceForm8K1999, pinskerHasFirmsForm2006, lermanNewForm8K2010}. We add to this literature by studying the behavior of corporate narrative disclosure in response to good and bad news, using market returns as an indicator of the underlying news.

The rest of the study is as follows. Section 2 reviews prior literature and develops our main hypotheses. Section 3 outlines the empirical design. Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 reports the additional analyses and Section 6 concludes.

\section{Theoretical Framework}
\subsection{Recognition and Disclosure} \label{sec2.1}
% What are recognition and disclosure?
\noindent A stream of literature studies the distinctions between recognition and disclosure in financial reporting \cite{aboodyRecognitionDisclosureOil1996, barthMarketEffectsRecognition2003, schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007}. \citeA[p. 301]{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007} defines recognition as ``depictions in numbers with captions on the face of the financial statements," and disclosure as ``display in the notes and supporting schedules that accompany financial statements."\footnote{Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5---\textit{Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises} formally defines \textit{recognition} as ``the process of formally recording or incorporating an item into the financial statements of an entity as an asset, liability, revenue, expense, or the like. Recognition includes depiction of an item in both words and numbers, with the amount included in the totals of the financial statements." \cite[par. 6]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984} but does not define \textit{disclosure}. Due to the absence of a conceptual definition of disclosure, prior literature on disclosure commonly interpret disclosure as any display that is not in numbers. However, this interpretation may partially overlap with the FASB definition of recognition, which states that recognition also includes words. As \citeA[p. 302]{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007} notes: ``both in analytical modeling and in developing financial reporting concepts, it is difficult to distinguish between recognized and disclosed information."} In this study, we follow \citeA{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007} and use the term narrative (or narrative disclosure) to denote textual disclosures presented in SEC filings, including notes to financial statements, supplementary information, and other means of financial reporting.

% What are the recognition criteria for recognition and disclosure?
Recognition and narrative disclosure are subject to different reporting requirements. For an economic event to be recognized in financial statements, a set of recognition criteria needs to be satisfied \cite{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}. First, the item must meet the definition of an element of financial statements (definition criterion). Second, the item must have a relevant attribute measurable with sufficient reliability (measurability criterion). Third, the information about the item must be capable of making a difference in user decisions (relevance criterion). Fourth, the information must be representationally faithful, verifiable, and neutral (reliability criterion). In contrast, narrative disclosure is more flexible because it can be deployed to disclose information that fails to meet certain recognition criteria \cite[par. 7b]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}. As \citeA[par. 7, CON5-7]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984} states:
\begin{adjustwidth}{0.8cm}{0.4cm}
	\begin{singlespace}
		``although financial statements have essentially the same objectives as financial reporting, some useful information is better provided by financial statements and some is better provided, or can only be provided, by notes to financial statements or by supplementary information or other means of financial reporting.''
	\end{singlespace}
\end{adjustwidth}

% The role of narratives
In essence, narrative disclosure serves two key roles. First, narratives can be \textit{supplementary} to recognition, conveying information that cannot be recognized because it fails to meet the recognition criteria. With respect to good news, because good news recognition requires a higher standard of verification, firms may convey good news via disclosure rather than recognition. For instance, under U.S. General Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), long-lived tangible and intangible assets cannot be revaluated upwards. When the market price of the firms' long-lived tangible and intangible assets goes up, firms cannot recognize the gain, but they may discuss it in other filings. With respect to bad news, despite lower verification criteria, bad news may still not be fully recognized. For example, although firms can create a provision for expected future payments from a potential lawsuit, they cannot recognize the associated reputation losses since it is extremely difficult to obtain a reliable estimate that can be verified subsequently. However, firms may discuss these broader impacts of a lawsuit in narrative disclosure.\footnote{Also, if the bad news is considered a remote contingent liability (less than 50\% chance of being realized), this bad news can only be disclosed in the foonotes. Another example would be internally developed intangible assets, which cannot be capitalized, and thus, cannot be impaired when bad news arrives. However, firms may discuss the impact of news associated with these intangible assets in narrative disclosures.} In sum, firms may use narrative disclosure to inform investors about the immeasurable, and thus non-recognizable impact of various corporate events to fulfill their obligation of providing relevant financial information to investors.\footnote{Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 states that it shall be unlawful ``to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made ... not misleading."}

Second, narratives can be \textit{complementary} to recognition. Complementary narratives are used to explain or provide essential descriptive information to the line items included in the firm financial statements. For example, for long-term obligations, narratives describe the due amounts, the interest rate and restrictions imposed by covenants, etc. For inventory, narratives state the measurement method used. In case of an impairment, the narrative may explain the circumstances surrounding it. For sales, narratives provide revenue recognition policies \cite[footnote 4, CON5-7]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}. In sum, firms may use narrative disclosure to complement the line items recognized in the financial statements, thereby enhancing users' understanding about the underlying economic events.

\begin{comment}
\citeA[footnote 4, CON5-7]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984} gives several examples on the complementary role of notes to financial statements:

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{1cm}
\begin{singlespace}
\indent \textit{For example, notes provide essential descriptive information for long-term obligations, including when amounts are due, what interest they bear, and whether important restrictions are imposed by related covenants. For inventory, the notes provide information on the measurement method used---FIFO cost, LIFO cost, current market value, etc. For an estimated litigation liability, an extended discussion of the circumstances, counsel's opinions, and the basis for management's judgment may all be provided in the notes. For sales, useful information about revenue recognition policies may appear only in the notes (FASB Statement No. 47, Disclosure of Long-Term Obligations; ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, ``Inventory Pricing", statement 8; FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, par. 10; and APB Statement 4, par. 199)}.

\end{comment}

Next, we define conservatism in narrative disclosure and elaborate on how it links to conservatism in recognized financial statements.

\subsection{Definition of Narrative Conservatism}\label{sec2.2}
% What are conditional and unconditional conservatism?
\noindent Prior work documents two main manifestations of accounting conservatism: conditional and unconditional conservatism \cite{beaverConditionalUnconditionalConservatism2005}. Conditional conservatism manifests as ``accountants' tendency to require a higher degree of verification to recognize good news as gains than to recognize bad news as losses" \cite[p. 7]{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997},\footnote{\citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997} does not use the terms conditional or unconditional conservatism. Here we quote \citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997} only to describe the manifestation of the two forms of conservatism, which are now labeled as conditional and unconditional conservatism.} and is typically measured by the asymmetric response of earnings to positive and negative stock returns. Examples of conditional conservatism under US GAAP include impairment/revaluation accounting for long-lived tangible and intangible assets, which mandates writing down the value of an asset by any losses incurred, but not writing up its value by the difference between market price and its carrying amount. Another example of conditional conservatism is lower of cost or market accounting for inventory under US GAAP or lower of cost or net realizable value accounting under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 

With respect to unconditional conservatism, it manifests as ``accountants' preference for accounting methods that lead to lower reported values for shareholders' equity" \cite[p. 8]{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}. Examples of unconditional conservatism include the immediate expensing, rather than capitalizing of research and development (R\&D) costs, and the use of accelerated depreciation for property, plant and equipment \cite{beaverConditionalUnconditionalConservatism2005}. 

% What is narrative conservatism and why focus on the three constructs?
Compared to the extant literature on conditional and unconditional conservatism in recognition, little work has been done on conservatism in disclosure. One notable exception is Guay and Verrecchia \citeyear{guayConservativeDisclosure2018} that study firms' commitment to disclose bad realizations of economic events in an analytical model. Guay and Verrecchia \citeyear[p. 73]{guayConservativeDisclosure2018} interpret a commitment to conservative reporting to include ``not only reported earnings, but, more broadly, any mechanism that commits managers to disclose, such as required footnotes and explanations in corporate filings." The model in Guay and Verrecchia \citeyear{guayConservativeDisclosure2018} focuses on the timeliness dimension of recognition and disclosure. We build on their analytical work and extend the notion of narrative conservatism to three dimensions of disclosure. Specifically, we define narrative conservatism as \textit{narratives reflecting bad news in a more timely, news-consistent and complete manner than good news}. Narratives can be conservative along each of these dimensions. We explain these dimensions next.
\begin{comment}
	As \citeA[p. 243]{kothariManagersWithholdBad2009} state:
	\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{1cm}
	\begin{singlespace}
	\textit{Considerable research examines conservative} recognition \textit{in accounting in the United States and internationally (Basu [1997], Ball, Kothari, and Robin [2000], McNichols [1988]). However, there is little systematic evidence to suggest conservatism in firms’} disclosure \textit{practices, with the notable exception of disclosure of bad news to mitigate litigation risk.}
	\end{singlespace}
	\end{adjustwidth}
	In a recent analytical work, \citeA[pp. 73-74]{guayConservativeDisclosure2018} have expressed similar opinions:
	\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{1cm}
	\begin{singlespace}
	\textit{By way of an analogy, 20 years ago, much of the accounting literature on transparent financial disclosure emphasized constructs such as earnings timeliness, high-quality accruals, and asset/liability recognition. Today, scholars study a plethora of additional financial disclosure mechanisms, including management forecasts, conference calls, management discussion and analysis (MD\&A) disclosure, press releases, and social media outlets. A commitment to timely disclosure of bad news need not come exclusively through financial statement recognition, and we believe that a broader view of conservative disclosure will offer new paths forward for a literature that has struggled to develop theories to explain the efficiency of timely asymmetric earnings numbers. We encourage researchers to pursue these avenues to better understand how the very large literature on conservative financial reporting integrates with the equally large literature on corporate disclosure.}

\subsubsection{Asymmetric timeliness with respect to good and bad news}

\noindent Financial information is of higher quality if it is \textit{timely}. Disclosure should be made \textit{in time} to influence users' decisions. Managers have discretion over the timing of disclosure \cite<e.g.,>{chapmanInformationOverloadDisclosure2019}, and this timing influences market reaction to disclosure. \citeA{alfordExtensionsViolationsStatutory1994} find that the market reacts negatively to delays in the filing of 10-Ks.

Commonly, managers disclose good news in a timely manner, while the evidence on the timeliness of bad news disclosure is mixed. Several studies document that managers tend to delay bad news disclosure. For instance, \citeA{chambersTimelinessReportingStock1984} find that firms accelerate good news disclosure while delaying bad news disclosure, and that investors interpret the failure to report on time as a forecast of bad news. \citeA{segalAreManagersStrategic2016} find that managers release bad news after trading hours and on the last trading day of the week to exploit investor inattention and minimize the negative impact on stock price. This strategic timing of bad news disclosure is also prevalent in private firms without stock price motivations \cite{brockbankStrategicTiming8K2018} and is associated with benefits in insider sales \cite{niessnerStrategicDisclosureTiming2015}. \citeA{baginskiCareerConcernsAffect2018} document that firms' delayed disclosure of bad news is positively associated with managerial career concerns. 

In contrast, other studies document that firms disclose bad news in a timely manner. \citeA{skinnerWhyFirmsVoluntarily1994} argues that managers face reputational costs if they fail to disclose bad news in a timely manner prior to a negative earnings surprise. Using a continuous-time disclosure model, \citeA{marinovicNoNewsGood2016} show that litigation risk not only induces timely bad news disclosure, but also suppresses good news disclosure since the market interprets silence as good news and firms can communicate good news without actually disclosing it, lowering proprietary costs. \citeA{yermackGoodTimingCEO1997} and \citeA{aboodyCEOStockOption2000} find that managers prompt bad news disclosure prior to stock option grant dates to lower option strike prices. 

Against this backdrop, it is unclear whether narratives are conservative in terms of disclosure timeliness. If narrative disclosure is conservative, according to our definition, firms should respond to bad news in a timelier manner than to good news. This gives rise to our first hypothesis:

\begin{quote}\label{hyp:h1a}
	\textit{\textbf{H1a:} Narrative disclosure is timelier in response to bad news than to good news.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Asymmetric news-consistency with respect to good and bad news}

\noindent We introduce the concept of \textit{news-consistency} to assess \textit{how} information is provided, and we interpret it as the degree to which firms use positive tone in narrative disclosure in response to good news and negative tone in response to bad news. %As the old adage goes, ``It's not what you say; it's how you say it.'' 
Tone influences how information is perceived or processed, and thus it can be employed both to inform or mislead. \citeA{davisNumbersMeasuringInformation2012} document that increases in tone optimism in earnings press releases are positively associated with immediate stock price response. Using a naïve Bayesian machine learning approach, \citeA{liInformationContentForwardLooking2010} finds that the average tone of forward looking statements in MD\&As is positively correlated with future earnings. Thus, news-consistency refers to whether and to what extent disclosure tone aligns with the real impact of the underlying economic event, as measured by market reaction to the event. 

We propose news-consistency as a second critical attribute of conservative disclosure. Firms may deploy a uniformly positive tone in both good and bad news disclosure, resulting in higher news-consistency in good news disclosure. For example, \citeA{huangToneManagement2014} document that firms strategically engage in upward tone management to boost market perception of firm performance. Based on their findings, when managers have incentives to emphasize the economic impact of good news, they may disclose bad news using positive tone, thereby creating higher news-consistency in response to good relative to bad news. 

Alternatively, to avoid litigation risk, managers may deploy a uniformly negative tone in both good and bad news disclosure, resulting in higher news-consistency in response to bad news disclosure relative to good news. \citeA[p. 2179]{rogersDisclosureToneShareholder2011} suggest that ``managers can reduce litigation risk by dampening the tone of their earnings announcements either by decreasing their use of positive language or by tempering their optimism with statements that are less favorable.'' Consistent with litigation risk constraining the use of optimistic tone in disclosure, \citeA{tama-sweetManagersAlterTone2009} finds that managers increase optimistic tone prior to option exercises when litigation risk is low, but decrease optimistic tone prior to option exercises when litigation risk is high. 

Overall, if narratives are conservative, we predict that firms respond to bad news in a more news-consistent manner than to good news. This gives rise to our second hypothesis:

\begin{quote}\label{hyp:h1b}
	\textit{\textbf{H1b:} Narrative disclosure is more news-consistent in response to bad news than to good news.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Asymmetric completeness with respect to good and bad news}

\noindent Financial information is of higher quality when it is \textit{complete}. Complete disclosure must include all necessary information for a user to understand the underlying economic event. Extant theoretical studies establish that managerial commitment to complete disclosure of news, good or bad, reduces information asymmetry and improves market efficiency \cite{glostenBidAskTransaction1985, diamondOptimalReleaseInformation1985, diamondDisclosureLiquidityCost1991, baimanRelationCapitalMarkets1996}. Empirically, using German data, \citeA{leuzEconomicConsequencesIncreased2000} show that firms' information asymmetry is reduced, and cost of capital is lowered after switching to the international reporting regime which requires an increased level of disclosure. \citeA{leuzDisclosureCostCapital2009} find that firms respond to the adverse shock of Enron scandal by increasing their disclosure level through lengthier 10-K filings, thereby reducing their cost of capital. 

Against this backdrop, we propose completeness as an essential attribute of disclosure. Narratives are conservative if they are more complete when disclosing bad news than when disclosing good news, i.e., narrative disclosure is conservative if it is asymmetrically complete in response to good versus bad news. In practice, firms may disclose good news in a more complete manner than bad news. \citeA{kothariEffectDisclosuresManagement2009} find that unfavorable disclosure increases cost of capital significantly. This penalization may induce managers to disclose good news and withhold bad news, leading to asymmetric completeness in narrative disclosure but in the opposite direction of narrative conservatism. \citeA{teohEarningsManagementUnderperformance1998} and \citeA{langVoluntaryDisclosureEquity2000} provide supporting evidence to this argument by documenting that firms issuing equity tend to disclose good news and withhold bad news. \citeA{rogersShareholderLitigationChanges2009} find that firms reduce the frequency and amount of disclosure post-litigation, suggesting that firms become more likely to withhold bad news for which they may later be held legally accountable. 

In contrast to this work, other studies document that managers have incentives to disclose bad news in a more complete manner than good news. \citeA{skinnerWhyFirmsVoluntarily1994, skinnerEarningsDisclosuresStockholder1997} finds that firms preempt negative earnings surprises with voluntary bad news disclosure to avoid being sued, or to minimize the costs of resolving any litigation that follows the disclosure of bad news. In line with this argument, \citeA{fieldDoesDisclosureDeter2005} find that disclosure of bad news deters certain types of litigation. 

In sum, if narrative disclosure is conservative, firms should respond to bad news by providing more complete disclosure than to good news. We formulate our hypothesis regarding asymmetric completeness in narrative disclosure as follows:

\begin{quote}\label{hyp:h1c}
\textit{\textbf{H1c:} Narrative disclosure is more complete in response to bad news than to good news.}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Conditional, Unconditional and Narrative Conservatism: Usefulness}
% conservatism role: stewardship or neutrality
The controversy regarding whether conservatism is a desirable property that enhances the usefulness of financial reporting persists. Traditionally, the usefulness of accounting information can be assessed in terms of how well it serves each of the two objectives of accounting---valuation and stewardship \cite{cascinoUsefulnessFinancialAccounting2017}. The valuation objective is to ``provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity \cite[OB2]{fasbConceptualFrameworkFinancial2018b}". For financial information to be useful for valuation objective, it must be relevant and faithfully represent what it purports to represent. Faithful representation further requires neutrality, which means that a depiction must be ``not slanted, weighted, emphasized, deemphasized, or otherwise manipulated to increase the probability that financial information will be received favorably or unfavorably by users". The stewardship objective is to assess ``how efficiently and effectively the entity's management and governing board have discharged their responsibilities to use the entity's economic resources \cite[OB4]{fasbConceptualFrameworkFinancial2018b}". Although not separately stated in the Conceptual Framework as one primary purpose of financial reporting, the stewardship role of accounting dates back several millennia and has been one of the main reasons for the existence of accounting \cite{lennardStewardshipObjectivesFinancial2007, murphyDiscoursesSurroundingEvolution2013, pelgerPracticesStandardsettingAnalysis2016}. On the one hand, conservatism contradicts the valuation role of accounting by introducing downward bias in financial reporting and thus weakening its ability to faithfully represent firm performance. For example, unconditional conservatism encourages firms to anticipate and recognize losses before their realization, resulting in a systematic downward bias in asset valuation \cite<e.g.,>[]{wattsPositiveAccountingTheory1986}. Conditional conservatism requires higher verification for good news to be recognized than bad news, leading to asymmetric timeliness in gain and loss recognition in earnings \cite<e.g.,>[]{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}. On the other hand, conditional conservatism enhances the stewardship role of accounting by improving contract efficiency. For example, in compensation contracting conditional conservatism limits managers' ability to overstate earnings and thus maximizing personal wealth at the expense of other claimholders \cite<e.g.,>[]{wattsConservatismAccountingPart2003}.

Aligned with the prior literature on the usefulness of conservatism, we argue that more complete, news-consistent and timely disclosure of bad news relative to good news enhances contract efficiency [specific hypotheses to be developed]. However, we do not make claims about the valuation role of narrative conservatism.

\section{Research Design}
\subsection{Narrative Disclosure Corpora} \label{sec3.1}
\noindent We study narrative conservatism using 8-K filings from EDGAR.\footnote{Non-public firms held by 500 (and in some situations, 300) or more persons and with more than \$10 million total assets, and all public firms are obliged to register with the SEC and file the 8-K form \cite{segalAreManagersStrategic2016}.} The 8-K form is a report that must be filed to notify investors about material events or changes in the company, where each event is classified as an 8-K item. \hyperref[appa]{Appendix A} provides a full list of 8-K items, listed under two distinct formats: before and after August 23 of 2004. This is due to a reform from the SEC consisting of three amendments: (a) expanding the scope of events subject to Form 8-K disclosure, (b) creating a new topical format, and (c) shortening the filing deadline \cite{secFinalRuleAdditional2004, lermanNewForm8K2010}. 8-K items are mandatory except for `Other Events,'  `Regulation FD Disclosure,' and `Results of Operations and Financial Condition.'\footnote{We follow \citeA{heMeasuringDisclosureUsing2020} and classify `Results of Operations and Financial Condition' and `Regulation FD Disclosure' as voluntary disclosure items, because their triggering event is the firm's voluntary disclosure of material events. \citeA{lermanNewForm8K2010} classify the two items as ``semi-voluntary" for the same reason. The item `Other Events' is voluntary following the filing requirement in \citeA{secFinalRuleAdditional2004}. } Deadline to file mandatory 8-K items ranged from five to fifteen days after an event in the late 1980s, and has been shortened to four business days after August 23 of 2004 \cite{lermanNewForm8K2010}.

Firms issue narrative disclosure via multiple channels, such as media, press releases, conference calls, annual or quarterly reports. We focus on the 8-K filings for three motives. First, 8-K filings are timelier than 10-K or 10-Q filings, i.e., annual or quarterly reports. In periodic reports, managers can bundle information acquired during the fiscal period and make summarized responses to all events in one single report at the fiscal period end \cite{segalAreManagersStrategic2016}. Given that one of our goals is to examine the timeliness of narrative disclosure, periodic filings cannot provide sufficient time variation in good and bad news responsiveness, and thus they are not an appropriate text source for the purpose of this study. Second, the contents of 8-K filings are under SEC scrutiny and biased reporting leads to higher litigation risk \cite{rogersDisclosureToneShareholder2011}. Therefore, 8-K filings provide higher credibility compared to firm-issued disclosures via social media and press. Third, 8-K filings are highly scripted and have higher reporting threshold than conference calls, which implies that corporate events need to have at least a moderate impact on firm operations to be discussed in 8-K filings \cite{hassanFirmLevelPoliticalRisk2019}. Hence, we filter out less relevant events and concentrate on the ones with material impact. Also, the fact that 8-Ks use predefined items to summarize the type of reported corporate events facilitates researchers to analyze the nature of the events in depth.

\subsection{Proxies for Textual Properties and News} \label{sec3.2}
\noindent We measure timeliness using the reporting time lag of SEC filings. Specifically, the 8-K reporting time lag (tlag) is the number of days between the news day, i.e., the nearest date around an 8-K reporting period date when there is a large change in daily stock returns,\footnote{See the exact definition of news day in \hyperref[sec3.3]{Section 3.3}.} and the filing date of the corresponding 8-K.\footnote{Alternatively, we calculate the 8-K reporting time lag as the number of days between the 8-K reporting period date and the 8-K filing date \cite{carterRelevanceForm8K1999, niessnerStrategicDisclosureTiming2015, chapmanInformationOverloadDisclosure2019}. Our results (untabulated) remain unchanged.} The shorter the lag, the timelier the narrative disclosure. If narrative disclosure is conservative, as predicted under $H1a$, we expect shorter reporting time lags in response to bad news than to good news.

We measure sentiment in narrative disclosure using linguistic tone and measure the degree of news-consistency by the marginal change of tone in response to increase (good news) or decrease (bad news) in stock market returns. News-consistency requires the marginal change to be positive, i.e., tone is positive in response to good news, and negative in response to bad news. Furthermore, if narrative tone is asymmetrically news-consistent, it implies greater marginal change of tone in response to bad news than to good news. That is, if narrative disclosure is conservative, as predicted under $H1b$, the change in narrative tone should be more negative in response to bad news than it should be positive in response to good news, given the same magnitude of news. Irrespective of the nature of news, under narrative conservatism, either bad news is emphasized or good news is attenuated, or both.\footnote{We provide the following numerical example to illustrate the concept of marginal change of tone. Suppose a 1\% increase (good news) versus a 1\% decrease (bad news) in stock return, which should move tone upwards and downwards, respectively, by 1\% if the response of narrative tone is neutral, i.e., tone responds equally  to good and bad news. However, in the presence of narrative conservatism, three situations may happen: (1) bad news emphasis: in response to bad news, tone decrease by 1.2\% and in response to good news, tone increase by 1\%; (2) good news attenuation: in response to bad news, tone decrease by 1\% and in response to good news, tone increase by 0.8\%; (3) a mix of both: in response to bad news, tone decrease by 1.2\% and in response to good news, tone increase by 0.8\%. In all cases, the marginal change of tone in response to bad news is greater in magnitude than that in response to good news. Therefore, under narrative conservatism, the marginal change of tone in narrative disclosure is greater in response to bad news than to good news.} 

We measure completeness using five textual attributes in 8-K filings following \citeA{birdInstitutionalInvestorsDemand2016}. Complete disclosure must ``include all information necessary for a user to understand the phenomenon being depicted, including all necessary descriptions and explanations" \cite[QC12]{fasbConceptualFrameworkFinancial2018}. Hence, more complete disclosure should be lengthier, allowing managers to elaborate on detailed explanations \cite{leuzDisclosureCostCapital2009}. Thus, our first proxy for completeness is the total number of words (nw) per day. Due to the irregularity and unpredictability of 8-K triggering events, 8-K filings have a unique data structure: though most companies only report one 8-K filing in one day and each 8-K filing usually contains only one or two 8-K items, some firms report more than one 8-K filing per day and each 8-K filing may contain more than two items. We make use of 8-K information content and measure completeness by the number of 8-K filings (n8k) and the number of 8-K items (nitem) per day. The more material corporate events are triggered in one day, the more items must be reported in one day, and thus the more complete the narrative disclosure is. Furthermore, 8-K filings can contain various exhibits and graphs, which provide supplemental information to the underlying events. Exhibits can include press release and contracts, and graphs are usually presentation slides or brand logos. We also measure completeness using the number of exhibits (nexhibit) and the number of graphs (ngraph) per day. The more exhibits and graphs attached, the more supplemental information are provided, and thus the more complete narrative disclosure is.
To sum up, if narrative disclosure is conservative, as predicted under $H1c$, we expect it to have more words, more 8-K filings, more 8-K items, more exhibits and more graphs in response to bad news than to good news.

% News measure and why stock returns
Following \citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}, we measure news with stock returns in our main tests.
In an efficient market, stock returns incorporate public and private information in a timely manner and therefore positive and negative returns are indicative of good and bad news.
Firms respond to the news by disclosing information of the associated events via 8-K filings. 
% One concern of using stock returns as a proxy for news is that firm disclosure should inform the market rather than the reverse. In a robustness check, we address this concern by applying the cash flow from operations as an alternative proxy for news.

\subsection{Sample Construction} \label{sec3.3}
%%%% 8-K filing data structure
\noindent We construct our 8-K sample in three steps. First, we aggregate the raw 8-K data at individual filing level into firm-day level. This is done by summing all raw count variables over each firm-day. For instance, the count variable $nw_{i,t}$ in our 8-K sample is the number of total words in all 8-K filings on one reporting period date \textit{t} for firm \textit{i}, instead of the number of total words of one specific 8-K filing. The same aggregation method applies to $n8k_{i,t}$, $nitem_{i,t}$, $nexhibit_{i,t}$ and $ngraph_{i,t}$. We construct TONE as the number of net positive words per thousand total words. Net positive words is the number of positive words minus the sum of the number of negative words and negations. We multiply net positive words by one thousand for ease of interpretation. We follow \citeA{loughranWhenLiabilityNot2011} and count negations as cases where negation words occur within four or fewer words from a positive word.\footnote{Negation words include: no, not, none, neither, never, nobody \cite{tottieNegationEnglishSpeech1991}.} By taking negations into consideration, we control for the fact that it is common to frame bad news using negated positive words, i.e., use ``did not increase" instead of ``decrease." We do not control for negations of negative words because firms rarely communicate good news with negated negative words, i.e, use ``did not fail" instead of ``succeeded" \cite{loughranWhenLiabilityNot2011}. We label a firm-day as ``8-K day” if at least one 8-Ks reporting period date coincides with that day.

%%%% 8-K news proxy
Next, we build our proxy for news. We obtain the daily market-adjusted stock returns (DRET) and calculate the change in daily returns ($\Delta$DRET). Then, we define a firm-day as a ``bad (good) news day” if the negative (positive) change in daily market-adjusted stock return ($\Delta$DRET) is three times larger than the firm's average decrease (increase) in daily return over the calendar year.\footnote{On average, each firm in our 8-K sample has two significant news days in a year. We code BN to missing if the firm-day does not have any news. Therefore, all observations in our final 8-K sample are either good or bad news firm-days. Bad news days make up for 53.6\% in the 8-K sample (\hyperref[T2PA]{See Table 2 Panel A}). Our 8-K results regarding asymmetric narrative timeliness are robust if we define news day using two and four times thresholds alternatively.} BN is an indicator for bad news day, which is set to 1 if the firm-day is a bad news day, and 0 if the firm-day is a good news day. We define good and bad news based on change in daily returns ($\Delta$DRET) because daily returns are volatile and may vary absent corporate events. Therefore, we only focus on firm-days with sizable changes in daily returns, which are more likely to result from significant corporate events and reflect fundamental firm information.

%%%% 8-K event matching process
Then, we match firms' news and 8-K filings as illustrated in \hyperref[fig1]{Figure 1}. Specifically, we match every 8-K day to its nearest news day. The matched news day can be earlier than (Match-1), the same as (Match-2) or later than (Match-3) the 8-K day. The Match-1 and Match-3 cases correspond to the following two situations. In Match-1 cases, the underlying events of the 8-K disclosure may be known already by the market, and 8-Ks trail the market. Events that are related to macro-economic conditions or industry factors, such as a change in monetary policy or a pandemic outbreak fit in this situation. In Match-3 cases, the 8-K may release new information to the market and the market reacts on the subsequent day. This is likely given that managers often release 8-Ks after hours or late on Fridays \cite{segalAreManagersStrategic2016}. After matching, we calculate TLAG as the number of days elapsed between the 8-K filing date and its nearest news day.\footnote{We match 8-Ks to news by \textit{reporting period date} because the reporting period date and the news release date are both about the actual date when the underlying event takes place. However, we calculate TLAG using 8-K \textit{filing date} because we are interested in whether 8-Ks are filed in response to good and bad news with different timeliness, allowing for managerial discretion in reporting speed.} We eliminate all Match-3 cases in which the market return movements occur after the filing of 8-Ks, because for this type of match we cannot accurately identify the date when the underlying event actually occurs. Our final 8-K sample consists of Match-1 and Match-2 with non-negative TLAG. In an untabulated robustness check, we include the Match-3 observations into our 8-K sample and calculate their TLAG as the number of days elapsed between the 8-K reporting period date and the 8-K filing date, and our results remain unchanged. 

The underlying assumption behind this matching process is that the 8-K filing and its nearest news release are triggered by the same underlying event. One concern of this assumption is that the 8-K filing and the news release may not be about the same event even if they are close in time. We provide validity check for this assumption by conducting a manual audit for 50 matched 8-K cases, and the results support the matching assumption that the 8-Ks are responses to their matched news releases (see \hyperref[appb]{Appendix B}).
%As a first check, we construct a \textit{restricted 8-K sample} by limiting the full 8-K sample to observations with reporting time lag less than or equal to four (five) calendar days for observations with reporting period date after (before) August 23 of 2004. Because firms must file required 8-Ks within four (five) business days of a triggering event after (before) August 23 of 2004 \cite{secFinalRuleAdditional2004}, 8-K filings reported within four (five) days of the news release date are more likely to be related to the precedent news, as regulated by the SEC.\footnote{Our restricted sample selection criterion is more restrictive than the SEC rule for three reasons. First, while the regulation requires firms to file 8-K within four (five) business days of a triggering event, we reduce this reporting deadline to four (five) calendar days, which is always shorter or at most equal to four (five) business days. Second, the regulation exempts the voluntary disclosure items from the four (five) business day reporting deadline \cite{heMeasuringDisclosureUsing2020}, but we still apply this reporting deadline to these items. Third, prior to the 8-K reform, 8-Ks must be filed within five to fifteen days depending on the nature of the event occurred, but we uniformly apply the five days deadline to all items before the reform. This more stringent sample selection criterion further ensures that the 8-K filings in our restricted sample are indeed responding to the precedent news.} We repeat our main analyses using the restricted 8-K sample and our 8-K results remain unchanged (see \hyperref[OAT1]{Table 1 of Online Appendix}).

\subsection{Model Specification} \label{sec3.4}
\noindent Once the 8-K sample is constructed, we use the following model to explore how 8-K filings respond to good versus bad news.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq1}
TEX_{i,t}=
&\beta_0+\beta_1\Delta DRET_{i,t-tlag}+\beta_2BN_{i,t-tlag}+\beta_3\Delta DRET_{i,t-tlag}\times BN_{i,t-tlag}+\\
&\sum\beta_nCONTROLS_{i,t}+\epsilon_{i,t},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta$DRET is the changes in daily returns and BN is the bad news indicator, \textit{at news release date}. CONTROLS is a vector of control variables. The right-hand side of Equation \eqref{eq1} resembles the conditional conservatism model in \citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}. Our model differs from the Basu model in that we replace earnings with seven textual variables to examine the responsiveness of narrative disclosure to positive versus negative market returns. Specifically, TEX represents a vector of textual properties that consists of reporting time lag (TLAG), tone (TONE), number of words (NW), number of 8-K filings (N8K), number of 8-K items (NITEM), number of exhibits (NEXHIBIT) and number of exhibits (NGRAPH). 

We include several firm characteristics that affect narrative disclosure as controls to alleviate omitted variable bias. Specifically, we control for firm size as measured by the market value of equity (SIZE), growth opportunities as measured by market-to-book ratio (MTB) and leverage as measured by total debt deflated by total assets (LEV), because the three firm characteristics are documented as the main determinants of conservatism \cite{wattsConservatismAccountingPart2003, qiangEffectsContractingLitigation2007, khanEstimationEmpiricalProperties2009, garcialaraEconomicDeterminantsConditional2009}. Following \citeA{liInformationContentForwardLooking2010}, we control for operating complexity of the firm (BUSSEG and GEOSEG), profitability (EARN), and operating risks (STD\_EARN). Firms at early stage may face more uncertainties which lead to more cautious narratives. More complex operating environment may contribute to more complex disclosure. Profitability is one of the determinants of disclosure, and we controls for it to capture managerial discretionary disclosure. Operating risks influences disclosure because risk factors need to be disclosed with more detailed and more cautious narratives. Following \citeA{huangToneManagement2014}, we control for the expectations of future financial performane by analyst earnings forecast (AF) and analyst forecast error (AFE). Detailed variable definitions are provided in \hyperref[appc]{Appendix C}.

The coefficient of interest in Equation \eqref{eq1} is $\beta_3$, which we interpret as the asymmetric responsiveness of textual properties to good versus bad news. We have predicted that if 8-K narrative disclosure is conservative, it will have shorter reporting time lag, greater marginal change of tone, and more contents in response to bad news relative to good news. Because $\Delta$DRET is always negative when BN equals 1, we multiply all count variables (NW, N8K, NITEM, NEXHIBIT, NGRAPH and TLAG) by -1 for ease of interpretation. Under our hypotheses, $\beta_3$ should be negative for TLAG and positive for all the rest of textual variables.

\subsection{Data} \label{sec3.5}
\noindent We obtain financial and segment data from Compustat, stock returns from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and analyst earnings forecasts data from I/B/E/S. We retrieve 8-K data from EDGAR (see \hyperref[appd]{Appendix D} for detailed description of EDGAR data collection process). \hyperref[T1]{Table 1} illustrates the sample selection process. We successfully parse and retrieve 1,540,911 unique 8-K filings out of 1,628,467 existing filings in EDGAR from 1993-Q1 to 2020-Q1. Next, we merge the EDGAR dataset with other datasets of firm characteristics and market performance. Finally, we screen the merged 8-K dataset according to the following criteria. We eliminate observations with missing value in key accounting and financial variables or with beginning-of-quarter stock prices below \$1. We exclude financial (SIC code between 6000 and 6999) and utility (SIC code between 4900 and 4999) firms because of their different accounting procedures, and because they are highly regulated industries which makes them incomparable to other industries. We drop observations (a) with non-positive total assets or book value of equity or common shares outstanding, or (b) with negative or above 99\% percentile reporting time lag, or (c) with below 1\% percentile total number of words (133 words). We further delete observations that are matched to news days that immediately follow another news day, because such news days may merely reflect the reversal in market returns after a dramatic change in the previous day. All financial variables except returns are winsorized at 1\% and 99\% level to minimize the impact of outliers. Our final 8-K sample contains 83,464 firm-day observations from 6,477 unique firms from 1993 to 2020. Sample size can vary across different model specifications and is noted in each table. 

\section{Main Results}
\subsection{Summary Statistics}
\noindent \hyperref[T2PA]{Table 2 Panel A} presents summary statistics for key variables. 
8-K filings respond to significant news in 15 days on average. TONE is negative on average potentially because the sentiment word list of \citeA{loughranWhenLiabilityNot2011} contains more negative (2,355) than positive (354) words by construction. Daily, 8-Ks contain 1,207 words in total on average. In more than 75\% of our 8-K firm-day observations, there is only one reported 8-K filing per day, and the maximum number of 8-K filings reported in one day is 4. Consistent with \citeA{segalAreManagersStrategic2016}, firms report two 8-K items per day on average, with the maximum number of items being 16. Firms do not attach exhibits and graphs or only attach one exhibit and graphs to 8-Ks in most cases.\footnote{The 8-K filing with maximum number of exhibits (\url{https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1145404/000095013508006951/0000950135-08-006951-index.htm}) reported 9 items, including `Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement', `Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets', `Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers: Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers'. The 8-K filing with maximum number of graphs (\url{https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/23217/000119312519102463/0001193125-19-102463-index.htm)} announced a live audio webcast of a presentation aimed at investors.} Regarding the financial variables, all but DRET and $\Delta$DRET are winsorized, so these two variables contain some extremely high and low values. Our main results of 8-K hold if we winsorize DRET and $\Delta$DRET.

\hyperref[T2PB]{Table 2 Panel B} presents the descriptive statistics of 8-K items before and after August 23 of 2004.\footnote{For brevity, we aggregate the sub-items into one 8-K item for observations after August 23 of 2004. For example, Item 1 subsumes Item 1.01, 1.02, 1.03 and 1.04. The same method applies to the rest of 8-K items. We specifically report the descriptive statistics for Item 2.02 because it is a voluntary item. The other two voluntary items 7.01 and 8.01 are the only sub-items in their categories so we do not report them separately.} The most commonly reported 8-K items before the reform are Item 7 `Financial Statements and Exhibits' (33.70\%), Item 5 `Other Events' (27.44\%) and Item 2 `Acquisition or Disposition of Assets' (12.55\%), whereas after the reform the most frequent ones are Item 9.01 `Financial Statements and Exhibits' (37.72\%), Item 2.02 `Results of Operations and Financial Condition' (18.91\%) and Item 8.01 `Other Events' (9.11\%). Voluntary disclosure, which consists of Item 12 and 2.02 `Results of Operations and Financial Condition,' Item 9 and 7.01 `Regulation FD Disclosure' and Item 5 and 8.01 `Other Events,' makes up for 43.66\% (36.31\%) of total 8-K items before (after) the 8-K reform. These statistics are consistent with \citeA{heMeasuringDisclosureUsing2020} and indicate that firms frequently use voluntary 8-K filings to report relevant events to users. After the 8-K reform, the average reporting time lag and the length of 8-K filings are substantially reduced, potentially due to the shortened reporting deadlines \cite{secFinalRuleAdditional2004} and SEC advocacy of plain English writing \cite{secDivisionCorporateFinance1999}. The average tone also becomes more positive after the reform. The rest four textual attributes do not vary much along time. There are significant differences across items in terms of and reporting time lag, tone, length and number of graphs. Within voluntary items, the tone of `Other Events' more negative and it is also lengthier than the rest of voluntary items on average, while `Reg FD' contains more graphs than other voluntary items. 

\hyperref[T2PC]{Table 2 Panel C} present the correlation matrix of key variables in 8-K sample. The correlations between our five proxies for completeness are almost all positive and rarely exceed 0.3. This indicates that the five proxies measure completeness from different angles, but they still share some coherence at the same time.

\subsection{Is 8-K Narrative Disclosure Conservative?}
\noindent \hyperref[T3]{Table 3} presents the regression result of Equation \eqref{eq1}. All regressions include firm and time fixed effects to control for unobservable firm characteristics and time trends that may bias our estimation. We cluster standard errors at 4-digit SIC code industry level to correct the potential existence of serial correlation in dependent variables \cite{petersenEstimatingStandardErrors2009}.\footnote{We cluster 8-K sample at industry level because firms within a same industry may employ similar disclosure policy, which leads to high correlations among observations in textual variables at industry level. Our clustering approach yields 373 clusters. Our results are robust to alternative clustering by firm. } As predicted by \hyperref[hyp:h1a]{H1a}, the coefficient of $\Delta$DRET$\times$BN is significantly negative for TLAG,
which suggests that 8-K reporting time lag is shorter in response to bad news than to good news---that is, 8-K filings respond to bad news in a timelier manner relative to good news. Also, consistent with \hyperref[hyp:h1b]{H1b}, the coefficient of $\Delta$DRET$\times$BN is significantly positive for TONE, which suggests that 8-K narratives are more news-consistent in response to bad news than to good news. Finally, in line with \hyperref[hyp:h1c]{H1c}, the coefficient of $\Delta$DRET$\times$BN is significantly positive for almost all textual attributes that proxy for completeness.

Overall, our results illustrate that on average, firms issue more 8-K reports, which contain more items, exhibits and graphs, in a timelier and more news-consistent manner in response to bad news than to good news. All results are consistent with 8-K narrative disclosure being conservative.

\subsection{Robustness Checks}
\noindent We conduct a battery of robustness checks. 
% T4PA using 6_regression_8-K_no_match.do
First, to ensure that our results are not driven by the 8-K reporting time lag calculated under a specific matching process, we replicate our main analyses using an alternative 8-K time lag definition. That is, we reconstruct the 8-K time lag as the number of days between the 8-K reporting period date and the 8-K filing date \cite{carterRelevanceForm8K1999, niessnerStrategicDisclosureTiming2015, chapmanInformationOverloadDisclosure2019}. We do not adopt this definition of 8-K reporting time lag in our main analysis for two reasons. First, the reporting period date is the latest possible date, but not necessarily the exact date at which the underlying event occurs \cite{secFinalRuleAdditional2004}. Second, this reporting period date is self-reported by managers. Therefore, managers may have incentives to prolong or shorten the lag, which creates endogeneity concerns \cite{chapmanInformationOverloadDisclosure2019}.

We use the change in daily returns ($\Delta$DRET) on the 8-K filing date as proxy for news, and set BN to 1 (0) if the negative (positive) change in daily market-adjusted stock return ($\Delta$DRET) is three times larger than the firm's average decrease (increase) in daily return over the calendar year. Our results (untabulated) are robust to this alternative 8-K reporting lag definition. 

% UT-3: CFO as alternative news proxy, did not work out

% UT-4
Second, to address the concern that our 8-K results are driven by a priori bad news items that are expected to be more narratively conservative than other items, we delete all 8-K days that contain any of the a priori bad news items.\footnote{\citeA{segalAreManagersStrategic2016} classify the following 8-K items as a priori bad news: Item 1.02 `Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement,' Item 1.03 `Bankruptcy or Receivership,' Item 2.04 `Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement,' Item 2.06 `Material Impairments,' Item 3.01 `Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing,' Item 4.01 `Changes in Registrant Certifying Accountant,' and Item 4.02 `Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.'} Our results (untabulated) are unaffected by the exclusion of a priori bad news items. 

% T4PA robustness
Third, to ensure that our 8-K reporting time lag strictly proxy for timeliness of narrative disclosure, that is, the time lag does not subsume the time needed to prepare quarterly or annually financial statements, we exclude 8-K days that contain information on quarterly or annual earnings, i.e., 8-K days that contain item 12 or item 2.02 \cite{segalAreManagersStrategic2016}. Our results (untabulated) remain quantitatively unchanged overall but the results regarding tone and number of words become statistically weaker. 

% Our 8-K results regarding asymmetric narrative timeliness are robust if we define news day using two and four times thresholds alternatively.

% In an untabulated robustness check, we include the Match-3 observations into our 8-K sample and calculate their TLAG as the number of days elapsed between the 8-K reporting period date and the 8-K filing date, and our results remain unchanged. 

\section{Additional Analyses}
\subsection{Narrative Conservatism in Quarterly Reports}
% motivation and 10-Q background
\noindent We explore whether narrative conservatism is present in firm-issued reports other than 8-Ks, such as the quarterly 10-Q reports. The 10-Q form is a comprehensive report that depicts quarterly firm performance, and it must be filed within 40 (for accelerated filers) or 45 days (for all other registrants) after fiscal quarter-end, according to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

% Variations between 10-Qs and 8-Ks?
10-Qs potentially provide more variation and diversity than 8-Ks in terms of narrative contents. 10-Qs contain sections such as the notes to financial statements (NFS) and the managerial discussion and analysis (MD\&A), where managers can discuss the economic implications of significant corporate events and issue forward-looking statements. Moreover, on average, 8-Ks are shorter (contain fewer words) than 10-Qs. These features imply that 10-Qs are more flexible in content, giving managers more discretion on what to disclose and how, allowing for more variation in linguistic tone than 8-K filings.

However, 10-Qs are not as timely as 8-Ks. 10-Qs are filed only once every quarter, on a relatively pre-arranged schedule that allows for limited variation in timeliness. By definition, 10-Qs cannot be as timely as 8-Ks in responding to unexpected corporate events, especially for those events that happen early in a fiscal quarter. In fact, one important motivation of the reform to 8-K filings in 2004 was to extend the number of 8-K items that must be reported within four days, to avoid delays in the disclosure of significant events until the due date for its next periodic report \cite{secFinalRuleAdditional2004}. Thus, the 8-K is the official SEC filing that allows firms to disclose material events in the timeliest manner. Furthermore, 10-Qs contain quarterly financial statements, so the reporting time lag of 10-Qs does not measure solely the timeliness of narrative disclosure, but the aggregated timeliness of recognition and disclosure. Therefore, we do not study reporting timeliness in 10-Q analyses. 

% method
We study 10-Q responsiveness to good versus bad news using the following model: 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned} 
		\label{eq2}
		TEX_{i,t}=
		&\beta_0+\beta_1QRET_{i,t}+\beta_2NEG_{i,t}+\beta_3QRET_{i,t}\times NEG_{i,t}+\\
		&\sum\beta_nCONTROLS_{i,t}+\epsilon_{i,t},
	\end{aligned} 
\end{equation}

\noindent where, QRET denotes the quarterly market-adjusted stock returns. NEG is an indicator for bad news, which is set to 1 if QRET is negative, and 0 otherwise. CONTROLS is a vector of control variables. TEX represents a vector of textual properties, including TONE and NW. In 10-Q analyses, we only measure completeness by number of words because the other completeness proxies are unique features of 8-K filings, which do not apply to 10-Q sample.  

We apply the same data collection procedure to parse 10-Q filings from EDGAR. Next, we merge the 10-Q dataset with other datasets of firm characteristics (Compustat), market performance (CRSP) and analyst forecast (I/B/E/S). Finally, we screen the merged 10-Q dataset according to the same data selection criteria as for the 8-Ks. Our final 10-Q sample contains 116,156 firm-quarter observations from 6,419 unique firms from 1993 to 2020.

% results
\hyperref[T4PA]{Table 4 Panel A} presents the result of Equation \eqref{eq2}. All regressions include firm and time fixed effects and standard errors are clustered at the 4-digit SIC code industry level. Consistent with \hyperref[hyp:h1b]{H1b}, the coefficient of QRET$\times$NEG is significantly positive for TONE, which indicates that the tone of 10-Q narratives are more news-consistent in response to bad news than to good news. Also, as predicted by \hyperref[hyp:h1c]{H1c}, the coefficient of QRET$\times$NEG is significantly negative for NW, consistent with 10-Q narratives being lengthier in response to bad news than to good news. The evidence indicates that on average 10-Qs are lengthier and more news-consistent in response to bad news than to good news and is consistent with the existence of narrative conservatism.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Narrative Conservatism in MD\&A and NFS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% motivation
In addition, we study whether narrative conservatism varies in different 10-Q sections. MD\&A provides an overall assessment of firm performance through the eyes of management and NFS provide detailed explanation related to each corresponding line item \cite{fasbConceptualFrameworkFinancial2018a, secFinancialReportingManual2019}. \citeA[Topic 9, 9110.2]{secFinancialReportingManual2019} requires that ``MD\&A should not consist of generic or boilerplate disclosure. Rather, it should reflect the facts and circumstances specific to each individual registrant.'' If narrative conservatism is driven by information disclosure rather than boilerplate, which has little information content, then we expect MD\&A narratives to be more conservative than NFS narratives.

% method
We extract MD\&A and NFS from 48,089 10-Q filings and calculate the logarithm of number of total words (NW\_MDA and NW\_NFS) and net positive tone per thousand words (TONE\_MDA and TONE\_NFS) for each filing. We reestimate Equation \eqref{eq2} using these proxies as dependent variables.

% results
\hyperref[T4PB]{Table 4 Panel B} presents the results. First, the signs of the coefficients QRET$\times$NEG are consistent with \hyperref[hyp:h1b]{H1b} and \hyperref[hyp:h1c]{H1c}, confirming that overall 10-Q narratives are more news-consistent and lengthier in response to bad news than to good news. Second, the coefficients of QRET$\times$NEG in Column 1 and 3 are more significant statistically compared to those in Columns 2 and 4, suggesting that the MD\&A narratives are more conservative than the NFS narratives. Overall, these results indicate that narrative conservatism in 10-Qs are driven by the discretionary disclosure rather than boilerplate.

\subsection{Voluntary and Mandatory Disclosure}
% motivation
\noindent We examine how narrative conservatism differs across voluntary and mandatory disclosure. \citeA{segalAreManagersStrategic2016} document that managerial strategic reporting of 8-Ks is more salient in voluntary 8-K items. Their results suggest that managers have more freedom to determine the timing, and potentially also the content and the rhetoric in voluntary disclosure. Thus, we expect voluntary disclosure to be more conservative than mandatory disclosure.

% method
Following \citeA{heMeasuringDisclosureUsing2020}, we divide 8-Ks into voluntary and mandatory disclosure subsamples by the 8-K items reported in each firm-day observation. We classify an 8-K observation as voluntary disclosure if it contains at least one of the voluntary 8-K items identified by prior literature \cite{lermanNewForm8K2010, heMeasuringDisclosureUsing2020}, i.e., Items 5, 9, 12 before and Items 8.01, 7.01, 2.02 after the 8-K reform. Otherwise, we classify it as our mandatory disclosure. Then, we reestimate Equation \eqref{eq1} using the two subsamples. 

% results
\hyperref[T5]{Table 5} presents the results of Equation \eqref{eq1} using voluntary (VD) and mandatory (MD) disclosure subsamples. Odd columns (even columns) show results for the voluntary (mandatory) disclosure subsample. The signs of the coefficients $\Delta$DRET$\times$NEG in all columns are consistent with \hyperref[hyp:h1a]{H1a}, \hyperref[hyp:h1b]{H1b} and \hyperref[hyp:h1c]{H1c}. For voluntary disclosure, the coefficients of $\Delta$DRET$\times$NEG are significant for almost all textual attributes, suggesting that voluntary disclosure is timelier, more news-consistent and completer in response to bad news than to good news. For mandatory disclosure, $\Delta$DRET$\times$NEG is only significant in terms of TLAG. The significant differences in $\Delta$DRET$\times$NEG between the two types of disclosure indicate that voluntary disclosure is more narratively conservative than mandatory disclosure.

\subsection{Time Trend of Narrative Conservatism}
% UT-5
\noindent We investigate the time trend of narrative conservatism. We estimate Equation \eqref{eq1} by fiscal year from 1995 to 2020. We start from 1995 because the 8-K observations in early years (1993 and 1994) are not sufficient for yearly regression. We retain the coefficients of the interaction term $\Delta$DRET$\times$BN for all textual attributes across years, and draw a timeline using the coefficients that are significant. If the coefficient is insignificant in certain year then it is replaced as zero. For ease of interpretation, we multiply the coefficients of TLAG by -0.1 so that they are expected to be positive and comparable to the coefficients of the rest of textual attributes. We also multiply the coefficients of TONE by 0.1 for the same reason. Graphically, the more conservative narrative disclosure is, the more positive the $\beta_3$s are.

\hyperref[fig2]{Figure 2} illustrates the time trend of narrative conservatism. The TLAG line indicates that narrative timeliness is present in almost all sample years. However, news-consistency and completeness are not present until 2007. Overall, Figure 2 demonstrates that narrative conservatism has become a consistent accounting phenomenon since 2010, potentially due to increasingly stringent regulation after the 2007 financial crisis. This figure also suggests that narrative conservatism is a prevalent disclosure behavior through time rather than a temporary disclosure strategy that only manifests during a specific time period.

\subsection{Narrative, Conditional and Unconditional Conservatism}
% motivation
\noindent We study whether narrative conservatism systematically varies with conditional conservatism (CCONS) and unconditional conservatism (UCONS). Empirical evidence on the relationship between the asymmetric behavior of narratives and conditional/unconditional conservatism is scarce. One related study is \citeA{daugustaDoesAccountingConservatism2020}, which documents that conditional conservatism is negatively associated with upward tone management. While they interpret their results as conditional conservatism disciplining tone management, their evidence could also be interpreted as consistent with the two types of conservatism being complements. Given the limited existing empirical evidence, and since narrative disclosure is endowed with both complementary and supplementary roles, \textit{overall} the relationships between narrative conservatism and conditional and unconditional conservatism is an empirical question. 

% method
We follow \citeA{khanEstimationEmpiricalProperties2009} to construct a firm-year measure of conditional conservatism (C\_SCORE)\footnote{See the C\_SCORE construction process and summary statistics in \hyperref[OAT1]{Table 1 of Online Appendix}. The summary statistics of C\_SCORE are consistent with \citeA{khanEstimationEmpiricalProperties2009} overall. } and merge the C\_SCORE with our firm-day level 8-K data. Next, we divide the 8-K sample into high and low CCONS subsamples using the median of C\_SCORE as a benchmark. We reestimate Equation \eqref{eq1} within high and low CCONS subsamples separately and compare the results across subsamples.

% results
\hyperref[T6]{Table 6} presents narrative conservatism across high and low CCONS subsamples. The coefficients of $\Delta$DRET$\times$BN are more significant in the low CCONS subsample compared to the high CCONS subsamplin termse  of TONE, N8K, NITEM and NEXHIBIT. For TLAG and NGRAPH, the coefficients of $\Delta$DRET$\times$BN in both subsamples are similarly significant statistically, but the coefficients in the low CCONS subsample are more significant economically (-4.639 v.s. -2.687 and 0.391 v.s. 0.244). These evidences indicates that firms with low conditional conservatism are more conservative in narrative disclosure, consistent with narrative conservatism and conditional conservatism being supplements.

Next, we study whether narrative conservatism systematically varies with unconditional conservatism (UCONS). We have argued that an essential role of narrative disclosure is to provide supplementary information when the underlying economic event cannot be recognized because it does not satisfy the recognition criteria \cite{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}. We study two cases where firms may not be able to convey news through recognition. First, news regarding intangible assets is often less measurable and thus more likely to be disclosed via narratives rather than recognized in financial statements. Second, because research and development (R\&D) expenses cannot be capitalized, firms are more likely to disclose news regarding internally developed intangible assets via narratives. To the extent that firms with high intangible assets and R\&D expenses are more unconditionally conservative because their book value of equity are usually understated, we expect firms with high unconditional conservatism to be more conservative in narrative disclosure as well.

% method
We collect quarterly intangible assets (INTANQ) and R\&D expenses (XRDQ) data from Compustat. We drop all observations with missing or negative INTANQ and XRDQ. Then we divide the full 8-K sample into high and low intangible assets (R\&D expenses) subsamples using the median of the natural logarithm of INTANQ (XRDQ) as a benchmark. We reestimate Equation \eqref{eq1} using the subsamples and compare their results.

% results
\hyperref[T7]{Table 7} presents narrative conservatism across high and low UCONS subsamples as measured by intangible assets (Panel A) and R\&D expenses (Panel B). In Panel A, the coefficients of $\Delta$DRET$\times$BN are more significant in the high UCONS subsample compared to the low UCONS subsample in terms of TONE, NEXHIBIT and NGRAPHT. For TLAG and N8K, the $\beta_3$s of both subsamples are similarly significant statistically, but those in the low CCONS subsample are more significant economically (-3.181 v.s. -6.326 and 0.049 v.s. 0.076). One exception is the regressions with NITEM as the dependent variable, in which we observe narrative conservatism only in the low UCONS subsample. Using R\&D expenses as the alternative proxy for unconditional conservatism (Panel B) yields similar results as in the case of intangible assets (Panel A). Overall, in line with our expectation, these evidences indicate that firms with high intangible assets and R\&D expenses are more conservative in narrative disclosure, suggesting that narrative conservatism and unconditional conservatism being complements.

	\subsection{Managerial Incentives to Withhold Bad News}
	% motivation
	\noindent We inspect how narrative conservatism varies in three settings where managers have incentives to disclose or withhold bad news. First, when firms announce a seasoned equity offering (SEO), managers have incentives to manage investor perceptions upward through earnings \cite{teohEarningsManagementUnderperformance1998} and disclosure \cite{langVoluntaryDisclosureEquity2000}. Similarly, we expect managers to be less narratively conservative during a SEO. Second, when executives anticipate a high value stock option grant, they have incentives to disclose bad news prior to the grant to ensure a lower option exercise price at the grant date \cite{aboodyCEOStockOption2000,bakerStockOptionCompensation2003,mcanallyExecutiveStockOptions2008}. Therefore, we expect narrative disclosure to be more conservative when firms grant stock option of high value to their executives. Third, we examine the role of litigation risk. Here, we do not have an ex-ante prediction because prior literature documents mixed evidence. On the one hand, when firms face high litigation risk, managers may have incentives to disclose bad news voluntarily to avoid being sued or to reduce the cost of resolving litigation that follows bad news \cite{skinnerWhyFirmsVoluntarily1994, skinnerEarningsDisclosuresStockholder1997}. On the other hand, bad news disclosure may itself trigger litigation \cite{francisShareholderLitigationCorporate1994}, creating incentives to withhold bad news \cite{rogersShareholderLitigationChanges2009}. 
	
	% method and results SEO
	For our SEO tests, we use Sale of Common and Preferred Stock (SSTKY) data from Compustat. We drop all observations with missing or negative SSTKY and we classify the observations with zero SSTKY into the non-SEO subsample. Then, we divide our 10-Q sample into five subsamples according to SSTKY, and label the subsample above 80\% percentile SSTKY as SEO subsample. We reestimate Equation \eqref{eq1} for the non-SEO and SEO subsamples. \hyperref[T9]{Table 9 Panel A} presents the results. SEO firms are slightly more conservative in terms of completeness, but are much less conservative in terms of news-consistency than non-SEO firms. Overall, this suggests that firms that are undergoing SEO are less conservative than those that are not, consistent with managers being less conservative when they have strong incentives to withhold bad news.
	
	% method and results option grants
	For the stock option grants tests, we collect data from ExecuComp from 1993 to 2006. We sum up the Black Scholes fair value of stock options granted to each individual executive (BLKSHVAL) by firm-year to create a measure of the value of stock options granted to executives for a given firm in a given year (BLKSHVALSUM). Then, we match this data to our 10-Q data by GVKEY and fiscal year and we drop all unmatched observations and matched observations with non-positive or missing BLKSHVALSUM. Finally we divide the 10-Q sample into two subsamples according to the BLKSHVALSUM of each observation, and we label the subsample with below (above) median BLKSHVALSUM as low (high) stock option value subsample. We reestimate Equation \eqref{eq1} for these subsamples and compare their results. \hyperref[T9]{Table 9 Panel B} presents the results. Only firms that issue high value stock option grants are conservative in terms of completeness, consistent with managers being more conservative when they have strong incentives to disclose bad news.
	
	% method and results litigation
	Finally, for the litigation risk tests, we classify firms into low and high litigation risk by industry membership \cite{francisShareholderLitigationCorporate1994,kimMeasuringSecuritiesLitigation2012}. Specifically, firms in the biotech (SIC codes 2833–2836 and 8731–8734), computer (3570–3577 and 7370–7374), electronics (3600–3674), and retail (5200–5961) industry are classified as high litigation risk, and all other firms as low litigation risk. We reestimate Equation \eqref{eq1} using the low and high litigation subsamples and compare their results. \hyperref[T9]{Table 9 Panel C} presents the results. Firms with high litigation risk are conservative, but to a lesser degree compared to firms with low litigation risk in terms of completeness and news-consistency. This is consistent with the finding of \citeA{rogersShareholderLitigationChanges2009} that firms reduce the frequency and amount of disclosure to avoid litigation. Our finding also provides indirect support to \citeA{francisShareholderLitigationCorporate1994} that bad news disclosure may trigger litigation.

\subsection{Narrative Conservatism and Firm Characteristics}
% motivation
\noindent We study if narrative conservatism systematically varies with firm size (SIZE), growth opportunities (MTB), leverage (LEV) \cite<e.g.,>{wattsConservatismAccountingPart2003, qiangEffectsContractingLitigation2007, garcialaraEconomicDeterminantsConditional2009} and proprietary costs. \citeA{verrecchiaDiscretionaryDisclosure1983} shows that as proprietary costs increase (that is as competition increases), firms disclose less information. \citeA{liImpactsProductMarket2010} find that competition from potential entrants increases disclosure quantity while competition from existing rivals decreases disclosure quantity, and that competition enhances disclosure quality.
% method
We follow \citeA{harrisAssociationCompetitionManagers1998} to measure proprietary costs using Herfindahl index.

%Specifically, we run the following cross-sectional model for each fiscal year from 1993 to 2015:
%\begin{equation} \label{eq3}
%\begin{split}
%EARN_{i,t} = \beta_0&+\beta_1NEG_{i,t}+\beta_2RET_{i,t}\\
%&+\beta_3RET_{i,t}\times SIZE_{i,t}+\beta_4RET_{i,t}\times MTB_{i,t}+\beta_5RET_{i,t}\times LEV_{i,t}+\beta_6RET_{i,t}\times NEG_{i,t}\\
%&+\beta_7RET_{i,t}\times NEG_{i,t}\times SIZE_{i,t}+\beta_8RET_{i,t}\times NEG_{i,t}\times MTB_{i,t}+\beta_9RET_{i,t}\times NEG_{i,t}\times LEV_{i,t}\\
%&+\beta_{10}SIZE_{i,t}+\beta_{11}MTB_{i,t}+\beta_{12}LEV_{i,t}\\
%&+\beta_{13}NEG_{i,t}\times SIZE_{i,t}+\beta_{14}NEG_{i,t}\times MTB_{i,t}+\beta_{15}NEG_{i,t}\times LEV_{i,t}+ \epsilon_{i,t}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%We obtain the estimates from Equation (3) and use them to calculate C\_SCORE and G\_SCORE following Equation (4) and Equation (5) respectively. C\_SCORE captures the incremental timeliness of bad news and measures conditional conservatism, with more positive value being more conditionally conservative. G\_SCORE captures the timeliness of good news.
%\begin{equation}\label{eq4}
%C\_SCORE_{i,t} = \beta_6+\beta_7SIZE_{i,t}+\beta_8MTB_{i,t}+\beta_9LEV_{i,t}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{eq5}
%G\_SCORE_{i,t} = \beta_2+\beta_3SIZE_{i,t}+\beta_4MTB_{i,t}+\beta_5LEV_{i,t}
%\end{equation}
%
%The mean and standard errors of coefficients obtained from \hyperref[eq3]{Equation (3)} and the summary statistics of C\_SCORE and G\_SCORE (see \hyperref[oat2]{Table 2 of Online Appendix}) are consistent with \citeA{khanEstimationEmpiricalProperties2009} overall. 

Next, we divide the 10-Q sample into quintiles of conditional conservatism (C\_SCORE), firm size (SIZE), growth opportunities (MTB), leverage (LEV) and proprietary costs (HHI). We repeat our main analyses as specified by Equation \eqref{eq1} by quintile.

% results
\hyperref[T8]{Table 8} presents narrative conservatism across quintiles of various firm characteristics measured by $\beta_3$ in Equation \eqref{eq1}. We do not include control variables in these regressions since some of the control variables, such as SIZE, MTB and LEV, are the expected sources of variation in narrative and conditional conservatism that we intend to study. In Panel A, the coefficients of QRET$\times$NEG are significant in Column 2, 3 and 5 in terms of length and tone, indicating that the three quintiles are conservative in disclosure completeness and news-consistency. However, the coefficients of the interaction are also negatively significant for the first two quintiles in terms of reporting time lag, suggesting that the first two quintiles are not conservative in disclosure timeliness. Therefore, we conclude that overall firms with high level of conditional conservatism, as represented by the highest C\_SCORE quintile, are conservative in narrative disclosure as well. This suggests that managers consistently apply a conservative reporting policy to both recognition and disclosure, and that the two financial reporting formats complement each other to some extent. We do not find evidence of clear patters in SIZE (Panel B), MTB (Panel C) and LEV (Panel D), which is consistent with C\_SCORE capturing conditional conservatism beyond its main determinants \cite{khanEstimationEmpiricalProperties2009}. Regarding proprietary costs (Panel E), we find that firms are conservative in terms of length and tone across all quintiles, and the degree of narrative conservatism is increasing across quintiles. This is consistent with \citeA{liImpactsProductMarket2010} that higher competition and proprietary costs increase disclosure quantity and improve disclosure quality.

\subsection{Bundling}
Using 8-K filings from 2005 to 2013, \citeA{segalAreManagersStrategic2016} find that managers strategically report negative news after trading hours when they believe that investor attention is low, and that firms bundle good and bad news disclosure to mitigate the negative impact of the latter. Consistent with \citeA{segalAreManagersStrategic2016}, \citeA{niessnerStrategicDisclosureTiming2015} find that managers systematically disclose bad news when investors are more distracted, and that this strategic disclosure of bad news is often accompanied with insider trading and earnings management. In sum, strategic delay or timing of bad news disclosure distorts the market and brings undesirable economic consequences.
\end{comment}

\section{Summary and Conclusions}

\noindent We define and document narrative conservatism. Using 8-K filings from 1993 to 2020, we analyze whether narrative disclosure responds to bad news in a more timely, news-consistent, and complete manner than to good news. We find that narrative disclosure is conservative. In particular, narratives in 8-Ks are issued faster, have greater marginal change of tone, and more words, filings, items, exhibits and graphs in response to bad news than to good news. In additional analyses, we document that narrative conservatism is also present in quarterly reports, and is more salient in voluntary disclosure. Moreover, we show that narrative conservatism is a consistent accounting practice across time and its trend becomes stable in the recent ten years. Finally, we provide initial evidence that narrative conservatism is more pronounced in firms with low conditional conservatism or high unconditional conservatism.

To our knowledge, our research is the first study to provide evidence of conservatism in narrative disclosure. Nonetheless, there are many unanswered questions. First, we estimate narrative conservatism along three information dimensions: timeliness, news-consistency and completeness. We do not construct an aggregate measure that encompasses all these three dimensions because we are cautious about creating a narrative disclosure index that lacks informational granularity and economic interpretation. However, we envision that such an aggregate measure of narrative conservatism may be useful for future research. Second, prior literature suggests that conditional conservatism reduces information asymmetries \cite{garcialaraInformationConsequencesAccounting2014} and cost of capital \cite{suijsValueRelevanceAsymmetric2008, garcialaraConditionalConservatismCost2011, guayConservativeDisclosure2018}, improves investment efficiency \cite{francisAcquisitionProfitabilityTimely2010, bushmanCapitalAllocationTimely2011, garcialaraAccountingConservatismFirm2016} and contracting efficiency \cite{wattsConservatismAccountingPart2003, zhangContractingBenefitsAccounting2008}. Future research may study whether narrative conservatism has similar economic implications, whether narrative conservatism along each dimension is equally valuable for information users, and whether different types of users have preferences over certain dimensions of narrative conservatism. Analyzing the potential economic impact of narrative conservatism will enhance our understanding of the motivations behind this pervasive managerial disclosure choice. Third, as an important extension of the second point, we posit that whether narrative conservatism has economic implications depends largely on whether and to what extent narrative disclosure is verifiable, or conveys credible information. \citeA{rogersDisclosureToneShareholder2011} propose litigation risk as an effective mechanism to ensure that managers are not simply engaging in cheap talk in narratives. Besides litigation risk, whether there exist other mechanisms, such as managerial reputation and career concerns, that regulate narrative disclosure is under-explored. To sum up, there are many research opportunities in the narrative conservatism area.
